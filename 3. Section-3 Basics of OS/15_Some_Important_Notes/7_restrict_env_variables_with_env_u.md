# Using `env -u` to Unset Environment Variables Temporarily

The `env -u` command is used to **unset** an environment variable temporarily for the execution of a command. This allows you to remove an environment variable from the current environment for the specific command without permanently affecting it in the system or other processes.

## Usage of `env -u` Command:

```bash
env -u VARIABLE_NAME command
```

Where:
- `VARIABLE_NAME` is the name of the environment variable you want to unset.
- `command` is the command you want to run without the specified environment variable.

## Example:

If you have an environment variable `MY_VARIABLE` and you want to run a command without that variable being present, you can use the following command:

```bash
env -u MY_VARIABLE node app.js
```

This will run `node app.js` without the `MY_VARIABLE` environment variable, even if it is set in the environment.

## Key Points:
1. The variable is **unset only for the command** you specify.
2. The environment variable **remains in place** after the command finishes and will be available for other processes.
3. This is particularly useful when you want to test or run a command without certain environment variables influencing the outcome.

## Example Workflow:

1. Set an environment variable temporarily:
   ```bash
   export MY_VARIABLE="value"
   ```

2. Run a command with the environment variable set:
   ```bash
   echo $MY_VARIABLE  # Output: value
   ```

3. Run a command without the environment variable using `env -u`:
   ```bash
   env -u MY_VARIABLE echo $MY_VARIABLE  # Output: (empty)
   ```

4. Afterward, if you check the environment again:
   ```bash
   echo $MY_VARIABLE  # Output: value
   ```

The environment variable is still there for future commands but was absent for the specific command you ran with `env -u`.
