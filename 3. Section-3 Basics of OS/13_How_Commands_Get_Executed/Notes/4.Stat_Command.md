In Bash, the `stat` command is used to display detailed information about a file or file system. The `-c` option allows you to format the output in a specific way using format sequences. The format `"%A %a %n"` is used to retrieve and display file permission information in both symbolic and numeric forms.

Here’s a breakdown of `stat -c "%A %a %n filename"`:

### Explanation of Format Sequences:
- **`%A`**: This displays the **symbolic representation** of file permissions, similar to what you would see in `ls -l`. It shows the permissions for the file in the form of `rwxr-xr-x`, where:
  - `r` = read
  - `w` = write
  - `x` = execute
  - The first three characters are for the **owner**, the next three for the **group**, and the last three for **others**.
  
- **`%a`**: This shows the **numeric (octal) representation** of the file permissions. File permissions are represented as a three-digit number, where:
  - **4** = read (`r`)
  - **2** = write (`w`)
  - **1** = execute (`x`)
  - These digits are combined to form permission sets, e.g., `755` means:
    - Owner: 7 (read, write, execute)
    - Group: 5 (read, execute)
    - Others: 5 (read, execute)

- **`%n`**: This shows the **file name**.

### Example:

Let’s say you have a file called `example.txt` and you run the following command:

```bash
stat -c "%A %a %n" example.txt
```

### Output:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 644 example.txt
```

### Breakdown of the Output:
- **`-rw-r--r--`**: This is the symbolic representation of the file’s permissions:
  - `-`: Indicates it is a regular file (not a directory or special file).
  - `rw-`: The owner has **read** and **write** permissions.
  - `r--`: The group has **read** permissions.
  - `r--`: Others have **read** permissions.

- **`644`**: This is the octal (numeric) representation of the permissions:
  - **6**: Owner has read (`4`) and write (`2`) permissions.
  - **4**: Group has read (`4`) permissions.
  - **4**: Others have read (`4`) permissions.

- **`example.txt`**: This is the file name.

### Summary of `stat -c "%A %a %n"`:
- The command provides both **symbolic** and **numeric** (octal) representations of a file’s permissions, followed by the **file name**.
- It's a quick way to view detailed permission information for files in your Bash environment.
