### Detailed Notes on Hoisting in JavaScript

#### Overview of Hoisting
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Variable Declarations**:
   - In JavaScript, variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` behave differently when it comes to hoisting.
   - **`var`**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. They are initialized with `undefined`.
   - **`let` and `const`**: These variables are also hoisted but are not initialized. Accessing them before their declaration results in a ReferenceError due to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

2. **Function Declarations**:
   - Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning you can call a function before its declaration in the code.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(myFunction()); // "Hello"
     function myFunction() {
         return "Hello";
     }
     ```

3. **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**:
   - The TDZ is the time between entering the scope where a variable is defined and when it is initialized.
   - If you try to access a variable declared with `let` or `const` before its declaration, you will get a ReferenceError.

#### Examples

1. **Hoisting with `var`**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(x); // undefined
   var x = 5;
   console.log(x); // 5
   ```
   - Here, `x` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`, allowing the first log statement to execute without error.

2. **Hoisting with `let` and `const`**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
   let y = 10;
   ```
   - Attempting to access `y` before its declaration results in a ReferenceError due to TDZ.

3. **Function Declaration Hoisting**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(myFunc()); // "Hello"
   function myFunc() {
       return "Hello";
   }
   ```
   - The function can be called before its definition because function declarations are fully hoisted.

4. **Function Expression Hoisting**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(myFunc()); // TypeError: myFunc is not a function
   var myFunc = function() {
       return "Hello";
   };
   ```
   - In this case, `myFunc` is hoisted as a variable but not initialized until the assignment occurs, leading to a TypeError when called before its assignment.

#### Summary of Key Points

- **Hoisting Mechanism**: JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
- **Variable Behavior**:
  - `var`: Hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const`: Hoisted but not initialized; accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
- **Function Behavior**: Function declarations are fully hoisted, while function expressions behave like variables.

#### Conclusion

Understanding hoisting is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code, as it affects variable accessibility and function invocation throughout your scripts. By grasping how hoisting works, you can avoid common pitfalls related to variable initialization and scope management.
