### Understanding `let` and `const` in JavaScript: Scope and Global Context

#### Overview
In JavaScript, the `let` and `const` keywords are used to declare variables. Unlike `var`, which declares variables in the global scope or function scope, `let` and `const` have a block scope. This means they do not attach themselves to the global object when declared at the top level of a module or script.

### Key Points

1. **Block Scope**:
   - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are scoped to the nearest enclosing block (denoted by `{}`), function, or module.
   - This prevents them from being accessible in the global scope, unlike variables declared with `var`.

2. **Global Object**:
   - In a browser environment, the global object is `window`, while in Node.js, it is `global`.
   - Variables declared with `var` at the top level become properties of the global object.
   - However, variables declared with `let` and `const` do not become properties of the global object.

3. **Accessing Variables**:
   - If you declare a variable using `let` or `const` at the top level of a script, you cannot access that variable as a property of the global object.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     let x = 10;
     const y = 20;

     console.log(window.x); // undefined in browsers
     console.log(global.x); // undefined in Node.js
     ```

4. **Creating Global Variables**:
   - To make a variable globally accessible while using `let` or `const`, you can explicitly attach it to the global object:
     ```javascript
     let x = 10;
     globalThis.x = x; // Now x is accessible globally

     console.log(globalThis.x); // 10
     ```

5. **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**:
   - Both `let` and `const` have a concept known as the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). This refers to the time between entering the scope where the variable is defined and when it is initialized.
   - Attempting to access these variables before their declaration results in a ReferenceError.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s an example that illustrates these concepts:

```javascript
// Top-level declarations
let x = 10; // Block-scoped variable
const y = 20; // Block-scoped constant

console.log(window.x); // undefined (in browsers)
console.log(global.x); // undefined (in Node.js)

// Making x globally accessible
globalThis.x = 10; // Now x is attached to the global object

console.log(globalThis.x); // 10

// Temporal Dead Zone demonstration
try {
    console.log(z); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
} catch (e) {
    console.error(e.message);
}

let z = 30; // z is now initialized
console.log(z); // 30
```

### Conclusion

- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are not attached to the global object because they are block-scoped.
- To make them globally accessible, you can explicitly assign them to the global object (`globalThis`, `window`, or `global`).
- Understanding these differences is crucial for managing scope effectively in JavaScript, especially when working with larger applications where variable accessibility can lead to unintended behavior if not properly managed.
