### **Explanation of Closures and Where Variables Are Stored**

---

#### **Code Example:**

```javascript
function hello() {
    var a = 20;
    function z() {
        console.log(a);
    }
    return z;
}

var result = hello();
// After 1000 lines of code
result();
```

### **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

#### **1. What is Happening in the Code?**
1. **`hello()` Execution:**
   - When `hello()` is called, the function is executed.
   - Inside `hello`, a variable `a` is created and initialized to `20`.
   - The function `z` is defined inside `hello` and has access to `a`.

2. **Returning the Function `z`:**
   - The `z` function is returned by `hello()`.
   - The returned `z` function is assigned to the variable `result`.

3. **Invoking `result()`:**
   - Even after `hello()` has finished executing, invoking `result()` logs the value of `a` (20).
   - This works because `z` forms a **closure** around `a`.

#### **2. What is a Closure?**
- A **closure** is a function that "remembers" the variables from its **lexical scope**, even after the outer function has returned.
- In this case, the inner function `z` "remembers" the variable `a` from `hello()`'s scope.

### **Where Are Variables Stored in a Closure?**

When a closure is formed:
1. **JavaScript Engine's Responsibility:**
   - JavaScript ensures that any variables captured by the closure (like `a` in this example) are stored in memory.
   - These variables are not removed during garbage collection because they are still referenced by the closure.

2. **Closure Scope in Memory:**
   - JavaScript creates a **closure scope** or **closure environment** that contains:
     - All variables from the outer function that are used by the inner function.
   - In this example:
     ```javascript
     Closure {
         a: 20
     }
     ```

3. **Heap Memory:**
   - The closure environment is stored in the **heap memory**.
   - Unlike primitive variables in the stack, closures need to persist after the outer function execution, so they are kept in the heap.

#### **Why Isn't `a` Garbage Collected?**
- Normally, when a function finishes execution, its local variables are removed from memory.
- However, if an inner function (like `z`) references a variable from the outer function (`a`), JavaScript keeps that variable alive because it is still being "used" by the closure.

---

### **Execution Flow:**

1. **`hello()` is called:**
   - The `hello` function creates a new execution context.
   - Inside `hello`, `a` is created and initialized to `20`.
   - The function `z` is returned with a reference to `a`.

2. **`hello()` finishes execution:**
   - Normally, `a` would be removed from memory.
   - However, since `z` (returned as `result`) references `a`, the closure environment stores `a` in the heap memory.

3. **`result()` is invoked:**
   - When `result()` is called, it accesses the closure environment.
   - The variable `a` is retrieved from the closure, and its value (`20`) is logged.

### **Visual Representation of Memory and Scope**

#### **When `hello()` is Executed:**
```
Call Stack:
    hello()

Memory:
    Execution Context:
        a = 20
        z = function z() { console.log(a); }
```

#### **When `result()` is Assigned:**
```
Call Stack:
    Global Execution Context

Memory:
    Closure:
        a = 20
        z = function z() { console.log(a); }
```

#### **When `result()` is Invoked:**
```
Call Stack:
    result()

Memory:
    Closure:
        a = 20
```

### **Key Takeaways:**
1. **Closures Persist Variables:**
   - Variables referenced by the closure are not garbage collected and are stored in the closure environment in heap memory.

2. **Efficient Memory Management:**
   - JavaScript manages the memory of closures dynamically, cleaning up only when there are no references to the closure.

3. **Practical Implication:**
   - Closures are powerful but can lead to memory leaks if variables are unintentionally retained.
