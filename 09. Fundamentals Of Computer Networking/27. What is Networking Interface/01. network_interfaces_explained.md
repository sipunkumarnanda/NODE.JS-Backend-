A **Network Interface** is a **hardware or software component** that allows a device (like a laptop, desktop, or smartphone) to **connect to a network** and communicate with other devices or the internet.

Think of it as the **“doorway” 🚪** through which your device sends and receives data.

* Hardware-based network interfaces are usually **built into the device** (like Wi-Fi cards or Ethernet ports).
* Software can also create **virtual network interfaces** (used in virtual machines, VPNs, or container networking).

**Key Roles of Network Interfaces:**

* Allow data transfer between devices 🌐
* Enable internet connectivity 💻
* Assign unique addresses (like **MAC address**) for identification on a network
