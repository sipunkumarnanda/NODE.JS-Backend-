---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Open Folder in VS Code**

1. Open **VS Code**.

## ‚úÖ 3. **Find Your Local IP Address**

This is the IP address of your computer on your Wi-Fi network.

### On Windows:

1. Open **Command Prompt**.
2. Run:

   ```
   ipconfig
   ```
3. Look for:

   ```
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.100
   ```

### On Mac/Linux:

Run in terminal:

## ‚úÖ 4. **Start Live Server on Your Project**

1. In VS Code, open your main HTML file (like `index.html`).
2. Right-click ‚Üí **Open with Live Server**.

By default, it will open in the browser on:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5500/
```

This only works on your computer. To access it from other devices, we need to change it.

2. Add this configuration:

```json
"liveServer.settings.host": "0.0.0.0"
```

This allows connections from **other devices** on the network.

3. Optional: Also make sure the port is 5500 or any free port:

```json
"liveServer.settings.port": 5500
```

## ‚úÖ 6. **Restart Live Server**

```

*(Replace with your real local IP)*
