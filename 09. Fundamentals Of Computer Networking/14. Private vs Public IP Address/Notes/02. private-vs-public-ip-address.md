
## 🔹 What Is a Static Public IP Address?

A **Static Public IP** is:

* An IP address **assigned to your router or device** that **does not change** over time.
* It is **reachable from anywhere** on the internet.
* It is often required for:

  * Hosting **web servers**
  * **Remote access** (like SSH, VPN)
  * **Gaming servers**
  * Surveillance systems (CCTV access over the internet)
  * Business applications

## 🔹 Why You Have to Buy It

By default:

* Most ISPs assign a **Dynamic Public IP**, which **can change** periodically (e.g., after router restart).
* This helps ISPs manage limited IP addresses more efficiently.

If you want:

* A **fixed IP address** that always points to your router/server,
* You need to **pay extra** to your ISP for a **Static Public IP**.

> Think of it like a **permanent address** on the internet for your home or office.

## 🔹 Example Scenario

Without static IP:

* Your router’s public IP today: `103.12.34.56`
* After restart or some days: changes to `103.12.34.89`
* This breaks any external connection unless you track the new IP.

With static IP:

* Your public IP stays the same: `103.12.34.56` permanently.
* You can point a domain (like `myserver.com`) to it reliably.

## 🔹 Alternatives if You Don’t Want to Buy One

If buying a static IP isn't an option, here are some alternatives:

### 1. **Dynamic DNS (DDNS)**

* Maps a domain name to your **changing IP address**.
* Services: **No-IP**, **DynDNS**, **DuckDNS**, etc.
* Your router updates the service every time your public IP changes.

### 2. **VPN or Cloud Services**

* Host your service on a VPS (like AWS, Azure) which provides a static IP.
* Or use cloud tunneling services like **ngrok**, **Cloudflare Tunnel**, etc.
