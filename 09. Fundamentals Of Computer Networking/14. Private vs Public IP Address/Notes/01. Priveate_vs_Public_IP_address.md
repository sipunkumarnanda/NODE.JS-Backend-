
## üîπ What Is the Difference Between Public and Private IP Addresses?

### ‚úÖ Public IP Address

* A **public IP address** is an IP address that is **accessible over the internet**.
* It is **assigned by your ISP (Internet Service Provider)**.
* When you search **‚Äúwhat is my IP‚Äù** on Google or websites like whatismyip.com, it shows your **public IP** (the one exposed to the internet).
* Every internet-connected device **must use a unique public IP**.

### ‚úÖ Private IP Address

* A **private IP address** is **used only within local networks (LAN)**.
* It is **not routable on the internet**.
* These are **assigned by routers** to devices like laptops, phones, printers.
* When you run `ipconfig` or `ifconfig`, the IP shown is usually your **private IP** (e.g., `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`).

## üîπ Why Was Private IP Addressing Introduced?

Originally:

* Every device had a **unique public IPv4 address**.
* IPv4 allows for about **4.3 billion unique IPs**, which was **not enough** due to the explosion of internet-connected devices after the 1990s.

To solve this:

* In **1996**, the **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)** reserved specific IP ranges for **private/internal use**.
* These **private IP addresses** can be reused in different local networks (like homes, offices).
* **NAT (Network Address Translation)** was introduced to allow these private devices to share a single public IP.

## üîπ How NAT Works (Network Address Translation)

### Example Flow:

1. Your mobile phone gets IP `192.168.0.199` from the home WiFi router.
2. Your router has a **public IP** assigned by your ISP (e.g., `164.2.9.5`).
3. When you open google.com:

   * Your phone sends request to router (private to private).
   * The router **translates** it to a public IP using NAT.
   * Google replies to the public IP; the router then sends the reply back to your phone.

This is **NAT in action**: translating between private and public IPs.

## üîπ CGNAT (Carrier Grade NAT)

* ISPs (like Jio, Airtel) use **Carrier-Grade NAT** to manage **millions of users** behind a few public IPs.
* Your router may **not directly have a public IP** ‚Äî it might have a private IP from the ISP‚Äôs internal network.
* All requests are routed through the ISP‚Äôs NAT system.

### Example Flow:

```plaintext
192.168.0.199 (Phone)
‚Üí 10.24.1.2 (Home Router)
‚Üí 100.64.12.4 (Jio CGNAT IP)
‚Üí 164.2.3.8 (Google Public IP)
```

So when you check "what's my IP", it shows the **Jio's public IP**, not your router or phone's.

## üîπ Reserved IP Address Ranges (with Purpose)

| IP Range                          | Type                 | Purpose                                      | Notes                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0` ‚Äì `10.255.255.255`     | Private              | Large private networks                       | Often used in enterprises                                 |
| `172.16.0.0` ‚Äì `172.31.255.255`   | Private              | Medium-size private networks                 | Less commonly used than 192.168.x.x                       |
| `192.168.0.0` ‚Äì `192.168.255.255` | Private              | Home and small networks                      | Most common in WiFi routers                               |
| `127.0.0.0` ‚Äì `127.255.255.255`   | Loopback             | Localhost (self-communication)               | E.g., `127.0.0.1` refers to the same machine              |
| `169.254.0.0` ‚Äì `169.254.255.255` | Link-local           | Automatic IP when no DHCP is available       | Used when DHCP fails; communication only within same link |
| `100.64.0.0` ‚Äì `100.127.255.255`  | Shared Address Space | CGNAT (Carrier Grade NAT)                    | Used between ISPs and end users                           |
| `224.0.0.0` ‚Äì `239.255.255.255`   | Multicast            | Multicast groups (one-to-many communication) | Used in streaming, video conferencing                     |
| `240.0.0.0` ‚Äì `255.255.255.254`   | Reserved             | Experimental / Reserved for future use       | Not assigned to hosts                                     |
| `255.255.255.255`                 | Broadcast            | Broadcast address                            | Sends data to all devices in a network                    |

## üîπ Summary

* **Private IPs** help conserve limited IPv4 addresses and are reused in different networks.
* **Public IPs** are globally unique and used to access the internet.
* **NAT** bridges private networks to the internet.
* **CGNAT** is used by ISPs to share a few public IPs with thousands of users.
* Reserved IP ranges have specific uses and are standardized by IANA and IETF.
