Data in a network travels **down from Application → Physical** at the sender, and **up from Physical → Application** at the receiver. Each layer **adds its own information** (headers/trailers) to the data from the layer above (encapsulation).

## 1️⃣ Application Layer (Layer 7) – User Interface 🖥️

**Purpose:** Interface for user applications; generates data for communication.

**Operations:**

* Generates **raw user data** (email content, web page request, file).
* Determines **type of service** needed (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

**Data passed to next layer:** **Message** (raw application data)

**Example:**

* Writing an email → text and attachments are packaged as message data.

💡 Analogy: Writing a letter you want to send.

## 2️⃣ Presentation Layer (Layer 6) – Data Translator & Serializer 🖼️

**Purpose:** Prepares data for transport; ensures receiver can interpret it correctly.

**Operations:**

1. **Serialization:** Converts structured data (objects, images, text) into a linear byte stream.
2. **Encryption/Decryption:** Secures data using protocols like TLS/SSL.
3. **Compression/Decompression:** Reduces size of data for faster transmission.
4. **Data format conversion:** Converts character sets (ASCII ↔ Unicode, EBCDIC).

**Data passed to next layer:** **Formatted Message** (ready for transport)

**Example:**

* Email text is compressed and encrypted before sending.

💡 Analogy: Encoding your letter in a secret code and folding it neatly into an envelope.

## 3️⃣ Session Layer (Layer 5) – Connection/Session Manager 🔗

**Purpose:** Manages connections between two devices; maintains and synchronizes sessions.

**Operations:**

1. **Session establishment:** Initiates communication between sender and receiver.
2. **Session maintenance:** Keeps track of multiple ongoing sessions.
3. **Synchronization:** Inserts checkpoints for recovery if connection drops.
4. **Session termination:** Ends communication cleanly after data is transferred.

**Data passed to next layer:** **Message + Session Header** (Session ID, sync info)

**Example:**

* Starting a video call → ensures both devices are ready and can recover if packets are lost.

💡 Analogy: Like a conference call operator connecting participants and keeping track of the conversation.

## 4️⃣ Transport Layer (Layer 4) – Reliable Delivery & Segmentation 🚚

**Purpose:** Ensures **reliable, in-order delivery** of data and identifies applications via ports.

**Operations:**

1. **Segmentation:** Splits large messages into smaller **segments**.
2. **Port numbers:** Adds source and destination port numbers to identify applications (HTTP=80, FTP=21).
3. **Protocol choice:** TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) or UDP (faster, connectionless).
4. **Error checking:** Adds checksum to detect corrupted segments.
5. **Flow control & retransmission:** Ensures receiver isn’t overwhelmed and lost segments are resent.

**Data passed to next layer:** **Segment = Message + Transport Header**

**Example:**

* Your email is broken into TCP segments with sequence numbers → ensures proper reassembly.

💡 Analogy: Dividing a long document into numbered envelopes and ensuring each arrives safely.

## 5️⃣ Network Layer (Layer 3) – Logical Addressing & Routing 🛣️

**Purpose:** Determines path and delivers data **across networks**.

**Operations:**

1. **Encapsulation:** Wraps transport segment in a **packet**.
2. **IP addressing:** Adds source and destination IP addresses.
3. **Routing:** Determines optimal path to destination using routers.
4. **Fragmentation:** Splits packet if it exceeds maximum transmission unit (MTU).

**Data passed to next layer:** **Packet = Segment + Network Header (IP addresses, TTL, Protocol)**

**Example:**

* TCP segment becomes an IP packet → routers use IP addresses to forward it.

💡 Analogy: Labeling the numbered envelopes with sender and receiver city/country.

## 6️⃣ Data Link Layer (Layer 2) – Node-to-Node Delivery & MAC Addressing 💾

**Purpose:** Delivers packets **within the same network**, adds physical addressing, and detects errors.

**Operations:**

1. **Encapsulation:** Wraps packet in a **frame**.
2. **MAC addressing:** Adds source and destination MAC addresses.
3. **Error detection:** Adds FCS (Frame Check Sequence) for detecting errors.
4. **Hop-to-hop delivery:** Ensures delivery between adjacent devices (switches, bridges).

**Data passed to next layer:** **Frame = Packet + Data Link Header + FCS Trailer**

**Example:**

* IP packet is framed with Ethernet headers → switches forward it based on MAC addresses.

💡 Analogy: Putting the shipping container on a pallet with local warehouse labels for delivery.

## 7️⃣ Physical Layer (Layer 1) – Transmission of Bits ⚡

**Purpose:** Transmits **raw bits** over a physical medium.

**Operations:**

1. Converts frames into **signals** (electrical, optical, or radio).
2. Sends **0s and 1s** over cables, fiber, or wireless.
3. Ensures proper voltage, timing, frequency, and bit rate.

**Data passed:** Signals are transmitted over the medium → next device receives and decodes signals back into frames.

**Example:**

* Frame bits converted to electrical pulses → sent over Ethernet cable to next router.

💡 Analogy: The mail truck drives the pallet from one warehouse to another.
