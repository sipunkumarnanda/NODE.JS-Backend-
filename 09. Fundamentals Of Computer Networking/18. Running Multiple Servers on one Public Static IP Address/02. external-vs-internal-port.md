When you host a server on your laptop or any device inside a network, you often configure **port forwarding** in your router. To understand port forwarding properly, it’s important to know the difference between **external ports** and **internal ports**.

## 1️⃣ What is an Internal Port? 🔒

**Definition:**
An **internal port** (also called **private port** or **local port**) is the **port on a device inside your private network** where the server or service is running.

* Used **inside your LAN** (home, office network).
* Indicates the service you want to access on a specific device.

**Example:**

* Laptop IP: `192.168.0.106`
* Web server running on port: `5500`
* **Internal port = 5500** → The router will forward traffic arriving for this service to this port on the laptop.

**Key Idea:**

> Internal ports tell your router **which application on which device** should receive the traffic.

## 2️⃣ What is an External Port? 🌐

**Definition:**
An **external port** (also called **public port**) is the **port on your router’s public IP** that is exposed to the Internet.

* Internet users send requests to your public IP on this port.
* The router receives the request and forwards it to the **internal port** on the designated device inside your network.

**Example:**

* Public IP: `106.51.109.226`
* Forward port `5500` → Internal laptop server port `192.168.0.106:5500`
* **External port = 5500** → The port Internet users type after the IP (`106.51.109.226:5500`).

**Key Idea:**

> External ports allow **Internet users to reach your local service** through the router.

## 3️⃣ Relationship Between External and Internal Ports

* The router maps **external ports → internal ports** for port forwarding.
* You can use the **same external and internal port** or **different ports**.

**Scenario 1: Same Port**

* External port: 5500 → Internal port: 5500
* User accesses `106.51.109.226:5500` → Laptop server at `192.168.0.106:5500`

**Scenario 2: Different Ports**

* External port: 8080 → Internal port: 5500
* User accesses `106.51.109.226:8080` → Laptop server at `192.168.0.106:5500`
* This is useful if the external port is already used or you want to hide the internal port.

## 4️⃣ Example Table

| External Port | Internal IP   | Internal Port | Service     |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 5500          | 192.168.0.106 | 5500          | Web Server  |
| 1234          | 192.168.0.106 | 1234          | Game Server |
| 3000          | 192.168.0.106 | 3000          | API Server  |

* Users on the Internet only see **External Port + Public IP**
* Internal port + IP are hidden inside your LAN

## 5️⃣ Key Points to Remember

* 🔹 **Internal Port = where the service runs inside your LAN**
* 🔹 **External Port = how the Internet sees your service**
* 🔹 They **can be the same** or **different**
* 🔹 Used in **port forwarding** to make internal servers accessible publicly
* 🔹 Security tip: Use only necessary ports to minimize exposure

### 🔹 Analogy

* Your router is a **reception desk**:

  * **External port = the door visitors use at the front desk**
  * **Internal port = the apartment number where the visitor should go inside the building**
* Without this mapping, visitors would **never reach the correct apartment**.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* **Internal port:** Used **inside your LAN**, identifies the service on your device.
* **External port:** Used **on the public IP**, allows Internet users to reach your service.
* Port forwarding connects the **external port → internal port**, making your local server accessible safely and efficiently.
