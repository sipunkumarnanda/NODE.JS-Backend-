**Definition:**
The IP range **100.64.0.0 â€“ 100.127.255.255** is **not a standard private IP range** like 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, or 172.16.x.x. Instead, it is a **special-purpose IP range reserved for Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)** by ISPs, as defined in **RFC 6598**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Points:

1. **Not standard private IP:**

   * Private IPs (RFC 1918) are for home, office, or enterprise networks.
   * CGNAT IPs are specifically for ISPs to manage multiple customers behind a single public IP.

2. **Not globally routable:**

   * Like private IPs, traffic from this range **cannot go directly on the Internet**.
   * It must pass through the ISPâ€™s CGNAT gateway to get a public IP.

3. **Purpose:**

   * Helps ISPs save scarce public IPv4 addresses.
   * Avoids conflicts with home LAN IPs (like 192.168.x.x).

### ðŸ”¹ Example Scenario:

| Device            | IP Address   | Type                          |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Laptop (home LAN) | 192.168.1.10 | Private IP (RFC 1918)         |
| Home Router WAN   | 100.72.45.10 | CGNAT IP (RFC 6598)           |
| ISP CGNAT Gateway | 203.0.113.25 | Public IP (Internet-routable) |

**Flow:**
`Laptop (192.168.x.x)` â†’ `Router WAN (100.64.x.x)` â†’ `ISP CGNAT (public IP)` â†’ Internet

### âœ… Summary:

* **100.64.0.0/10** behaves like private IPs: not visible on the Internet.
* **Key difference:** Itâ€™s **reserved for ISP CGNAT use**, not for general private networks.
* Allows ISPs to **share a single public IP among many customers**, solving IPv4 scarcity.
