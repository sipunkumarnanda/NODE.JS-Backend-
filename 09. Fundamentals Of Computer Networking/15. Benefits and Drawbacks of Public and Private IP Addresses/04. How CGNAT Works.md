1. Your home router or phone gets a **private IP** from the ISP (not a real public one).

   * ISPs often use a special block: **100.64.0.0/10** (reserved for CGNAT).
   * Example: You might see something like `100.72.45.10` on your router‚Äôs WAN interface.

2. The ISP‚Äôs **CGNAT server** keeps a huge NAT table, mapping thousands of customers‚Äô private IP + port numbers to a few shared **public IPs**.

3. To the outside Internet, your traffic looks like it‚Äôs coming from one of those **shared public IPs**.

### üîπ Example:

* You (customer A): ISP gives you `100.72.45.10` (private, CGNAT).
* Your neighbor (customer B): ISP gives `100.72.45.11`.
* Both of you go online ‚Üí CGNAT server translates both into `203.0.113.50` (shared public).

To the website you visit, both you and your neighbor appear to come from the **same public IP**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawback of CGNAT

Because you only have a private IP from your ISP:

* You **cannot host servers** (like a game server or web server) unless the ISP offers special support.
* Some apps (gaming, peer-to-peer, VoIP) may fail because the outside world cannot directly connect back to your private IP.

---

‚úÖ **So yes:** In CGNAT, the ISP gives you a private IP (usually from `100.64.0.0/10`), then translates it at the carrier side into a shared public IP.

## üìå Difference Between ISP Giving 192.168.x.x vs 100.64.x.x in CGNAT

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ISP gives you **192.168.x.x** (or 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x)

* These are **normal private IP ranges** (RFC 1918).
* Problem: You already use 192.168.x.x inside your **home LAN**.

  * Example: Your Wi-Fi router gives your laptop `192.168.1.5`.
  * If ISP also gives your router `192.168.0.10`, it creates **confusion/conflict**.
* That‚Äôs why ISPs avoid using 192.168.x.x for CGNAT.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ISP gives you **100.64.0.0/10** (special range for CGNAT)

* Range: `100.64.0.0 ‚Äì 100.127.255.255`.
* Reserved by IETF **specifically for ISPs doing CGNAT** (RFC 6598).
* Advantage:

  * Doesn‚Äôt clash with your home network private IPs (192.168.x.x).
  * Easier for ISPs to manage NAT mappings across millions of customers.
* Example:

  * Your router WAN IP = `100.72.45.10` (CGNAT private).
  * ISP CGNAT gateway = translates it to public `203.0.113.25`.

### üìù Quick Comparison

| Case         | What ISP gives         | Problem / Advantage                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old way      | 192.168.x.x / 10.x.x.x | Can **conflict** with your home LAN addresses (double NAT mess) |
| Modern CGNAT | 100.64.x.x             | Special block, no conflicts, made for ISPs to run CGNAT         |

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**

* **192.168.x.x** ‚Üí meant for your **home/office LAN**, not ideal for ISPs.
* **100.64.x.x** ‚Üí special range reserved for **ISPs to use in CGNAT** (avoids conflict with your LAN).
