**Where used:**

* At **home routers**, **small offices**, or sometimes in enterprise networks.

**Why used:**

* To let many devices inside a private network (with private IPs) share **one public IP**.
* To conserve IPv4 addresses and provide a basic layer of protection (devices are not directly exposed).

**Example:**
üè† Your home:

* Devices: `192.168.1.2` (phone), `192.168.1.3` (laptop), `192.168.1.4` (smart TV).
* Router gives them private IPs, but all use **one public IP** (like `203.0.113.10`) to connect to the Internet.

## üåç CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT, also called Large-Scale NAT)

**Where used:**

* By **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** or **mobile networks**.

**Why used:**

* To allow **thousands or millions of customers** to share a smaller pool of public IPv4 addresses.
* Needed because IPv4 addresses are limited and ISPs cannot assign a unique public IP to every customer.

**Example:**
üì± Mobile operator:

* Millions of users connect to the Internet.
* Instead of giving each SIM card a public IP, the ISP puts customers behind **CGNAT**.
* To websites, it looks like thousands of users are coming from the **same public IP**.

## ‚öñÔ∏è NAT vs CGNAT (Quick Comparison)

| Feature          | NAT                        | CGNAT                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who uses it?     | End-users (home/office)    | ISPs / telecoms                                                                  |
| Scale            | Dozens/hundreds of devices | Thousands/millions of users                                                      |
| Public IP needed | One per home/office        | One per many customers                                                           |
| Issues           | Usually none               | Can break hosting, gaming, peer-to-peer, VoIP (hard to reach users inside CGNAT) |

‚úÖ **In short:**

* Use **NAT** at your router to connect your private devices to the Internet.
* ISPs use **CGNAT** to stretch limited IPv4 addresses across many customers.
