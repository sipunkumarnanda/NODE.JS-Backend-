**Definition:**
**RFC 6598** is a technical standard published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that defines the **‚ÄúAddress Allocation for Private Internets Used in Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)‚Äù**.

In simple words:

* It reserves the IP range **100.64.0.0 ‚Äì 100.127.255.255** specifically for **ISPs to use in CGNAT networks**.
* This range is **not routable on the public Internet**, similar to private IPs (192.168.x.x), but it is meant **only for ISP networks**, not home or office LANs.

### üîπ Why RFC 6598 is important:

1. **Solves IPv4 scarcity:**

   * ISPs can assign private IPs to many customers and share a single public IP.
2. **Avoids conflicts:**

   * Home networks use 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, or 172.16.x.x.
   * CGNAT uses 100.64.x.x so there‚Äôs no overlap.
3. **Standardizes CGNAT addressing:**

   * Ensures that all ISPs and network equipment follow the same rules.

### üîπ Quick example:

* ISP assigns your router WAN IP = `100.72.45.10` (CGNAT IP per RFC 6598)
* ISP CGNAT maps it to public IP = `203.0.113.25`
* To the Internet, your devices appear to come from the public IP, not the 100.64.x.x IP.

‚úÖ **Summary:**
RFC 6598 = the official standard for **ISP CGNAT private IP allocation**, using **100.64.0.0/10**, to help share public IPs among many customers.
