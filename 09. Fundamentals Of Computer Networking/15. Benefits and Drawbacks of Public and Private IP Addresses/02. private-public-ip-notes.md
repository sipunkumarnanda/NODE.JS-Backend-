Private IP addresses are divided into **three main ranges (blocks)**. Each block has a different size and is used in different situations depending on the size of the network.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. `10.0.0.0/8`

ðŸ‘‰ Covers: `10.0.0.0 â€“ 10.255.255.255`
ðŸ‘‰ Total: **16,777,216 addresses** (huge block)

**When & Why:**

* Best for **very large organizations**, enterprises, ISPs, or cloud providers.
* Used when you need millions of private IPs across many sub-networks.
* Example: A university with 50,000+ devices, or a company that wants to organize departments into many subnetworks.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. `172.16.0.0/12`

ðŸ‘‰ Covers: `172.16.0.0 â€“ 172.31.255.255`
ðŸ‘‰ Total: **1,048,576 addresses** (medium block)

**When & Why:**

* Good for **medium-sized networks**.
* Often used in companies that donâ€™t need the massive size of the `10.x.x.x` range but want more flexibility than `192.168.x.x`.
* Example: A hospital, university campus, or regional office network with thousands of devices.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. `192.168.0.0/16`

ðŸ‘‰ Covers: `192.168.0.0 â€“ 192.168.255.255`
ðŸ‘‰ Total: **65,536 addresses** (small block)

**When & Why:**

* Most common for **homes and small offices**.
* Easy to configure, default in many Wi-Fi routers (like `192.168.0.1` or `192.168.1.1`).
* Example: Your home Wi-Fi giving private IPs like `192.168.1.2` to your phone and `192.168.1.3` to your laptop.

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary: When to Use What

* **10.x.x.x â†’** Very large networks (millions of devices).
* **172.16.x.x â†’** Medium networks (thousands of devices).
* **192.168.x.x â†’** Small networks (homes, small offices).

âš¡Pro tip: Most home users will only ever see the `192.168.x.x` range because thatâ€™s the default in consumer routers.
