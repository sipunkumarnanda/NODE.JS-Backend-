When you buy a **domain name** (like `example.com`) from a registrar such as GoDaddy, it doesn‚Äôt automatically know where your website or server is. To make it point to your server, you use **DNS records**.

Your server usually has a **static public IP address** (IPv4 or IPv6). DNS records tell the internet: ‚ÄúHey, when someone types this domain, go to this IP!‚Äù

# üìù 2. DNS Basics

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the **phonebook of the internet**. It maps human-readable names (`example.com`) to IP addresses (`192.168.1.1` for IPv4 or `2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946` for IPv6).

There are different types of DNS records:

1. **A Record (IPv4)**
2. **AAAA Record (IPv6)**
3. **CNAME Record**
4. **@ Record**
5. **Other records (MX, TXT, etc.)** ‚Äì for email, verification, etc.

Let‚Äôs go in depth for each.

# üñ•Ô∏è 3. A Record (IPv4)

* **Purpose:** Maps your domain name to an **IPv4 address**.
* **Example:** Your server has IPv4 `203.0.113.10`.

| Field | Example                |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| Type  | A                      |
| Name  | @ (or `www`)           |
| Value | 203.0.113.10           |
| TTL   | 3600 (seconds, 1 hour) |

**Explanation:**

* `@` means the root domain (`example.com`).
* `www` means `www.example.com`. You can add both if you want users to access your site with or without `www`.

üí° **Tip:** Always add `www` as a separate A record pointing to the same IP.

---

# üåà 4. AAAA Record (IPv6)

* **Purpose:** Maps your domain to an **IPv6 address**.
* **Example:** Your server IPv6 is `2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946`.

| Field | Example                            |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| Type  | AAAA                               |
| Name  | @ or `www`                         |
| Value | 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 |
| TTL   | 3600                               |

**Explanation:**

* Works same as A record but for IPv6.
* Many modern networks support IPv6, so adding AAAA makes your site accessible to all devices.

---

# üîó 5. CNAME Record

* **Purpose:** Creates an **alias** for another domain.
* **Example:** You want `blog.example.com` to point to `example.com` (so it follows whatever IP `example.com` uses).

| Field | Example     |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Type  | CNAME       |
| Name  | blog        |
| Value | example.com |
| TTL   | 3600        |

**Explanation:**

* CNAME never points to an IP directly; it points to another **domain**.
* Great for subdomains like `blog`, `shop`, or `mail`.

üí° **Tip:** Don‚Äôt mix CNAME and A for the same name. Either alias with CNAME or point to IP with A/AAAA.

---

# üè∑Ô∏è 6. @ Record

* **Purpose:** Represents the **root domain** (`example.com`) in DNS records.
* Used in **A, AAAA, or MX records** to avoid typing the full domain name.

| Example   | Explanation                 |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Name: @   | Refers to `example.com`     |
| Name: www | Refers to `www.example.com` |

---

# üõ†Ô∏è 7. Putting it all together (Example)

Suppose your server has:

* IPv4: `203.0.113.10`
* IPv6: `2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946`

DNS setup:

| Type  | Name | Value                              | TTL  |
| ----- | ---- | ---------------------------------- | ---- |
| A     | @    | 203.0.113.10                       | 3600 |
| A     | www  | 203.0.113.10                       | 3600 |
| AAAA  | @    | 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 | 3600 |
| AAAA  | www  | 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 | 3600 |
| CNAME | blog | example.com                        | 3600 |

**Explanation:**

* `@` ‚Üí main domain points to your server.
* `www` ‚Üí same IP as main domain.
* `blog` ‚Üí points to `example.com` (alias).
* Works for IPv4 & IPv6 visitors.

# ‚ö° 8. Tips & Best Practices

1. **Static IP:** Make sure your IP doesn‚Äôt change; otherwise your domain will break.
2. **TTL (Time To Live):** 3600 seconds (1 hour) is default; lower if you plan frequent changes.
3. **Propagation:** DNS changes can take 10‚Äì60 minutes to take effect globally.
4. **Test:** Use `ping example.com` or `nslookup example.com` to verify setup.
5. **HTTPS:** After pointing your domain to your server, use SSL certificates (Let‚Äôs Encrypt) for secure access.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**

* **A record** ‚Üí IPv4
* **AAAA record** ‚Üí IPv6
* **CNAME record** ‚Üí alias another domain
* **@ record** ‚Üí root domain (`example.com`)
* **www** ‚Üí common subdomain pointing to main IP

Once you understand these, you can confidently set up domains, subdomains, and even configure email, CDN, and more advanced setups.
