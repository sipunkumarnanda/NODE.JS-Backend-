
## 🌐 **What is a WAN?**

A **WAN (Wide Area Network)** connects devices or networks **across different physical locations**. In your case, you're connecting **Router A's LAN** to **Router B's WAN** to **extend the network** and allow communication between devices on different routers.

## 🔧 **What You Did Today (Simple WAN Setup)**

### 🛠️ Setup Summary:

* **Router A**: Main router (connected to the internet or your upstream network)
* **Router B**: Secondary router (connected via WAN port to Router A’s LAN port)

### ⚙️ Physical Connection:

```
[Internet]
    |
[Router A] ---LAN---> WAN [Router B]
```

## 🧠 **What’s Happening Behind the Scenes**

| Component                 | Explanation                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Router A (Upstream)**   | Acts like your "ISP" or main gateway. It gives internet or local network access to other devices.         |
| **Router B (Downstream)** | Acts like a client device to Router A — gets its IP on WAN side from Router A’s LAN (via DHCP or static). |
| **WAN Port (Router B)**   | Treated as a different "outside" network — separates it from Router B’s internal LAN.                     |
| **NAT**                   | Router B likely performs NAT again, so devices behind it are double-NATed unless you bridge or DMZ.       |
| **DHCP**                  | Router B gives IPs to devices connected to its LAN. These are different from Router A’s LAN.              |

## 📦 Example IP Addressing

| Device             | Interface | IP Address                  | Notes                           |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Router A           | LAN       | 192.168.1.1                 | Main router                     |
| Router B           | WAN       | 192.168.1.2 (from Router A) | Looks like a client to Router A |
| Router B           | LAN       | 192.168.2.1                 | Its own internal subnet         |
| PC behind Router B | LAN       | 192.168.2.10                | Gets internet via Router B      |

## 🔄 **Why Do This?**

* **Learn routing and NAT behavior**
* **Practice ISP-like setups**
* **Build your own ISP or test network**
* **Isolate networks** (e.g., guest Wi-Fi, labs, etc.)
* **Simulate WAN links between sites**

| Concept                  | What to Try                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Routes**        | Let devices on Router A talk to devices behind Router B                     |
| **Bridging**             | Put Router B in bridge mode so it acts like a switch, not a separate router |
| **PPPoE**                | Simulate ISP behavior by making Router A a PPPoE server and B the client    |
| **VLANs**                | Use VLANs to segment traffic over a single cable                            |
| **GRE or IPsec Tunnels** | Simulate secure WAN tunnels like in real ISPs                               |
