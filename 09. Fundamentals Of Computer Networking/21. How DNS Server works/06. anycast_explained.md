**Anycast** is a **network addressing and routing technique** where the **same IP address** is assigned to multiple servers (nodes) located in **different geographic locations**.

When a user sends a request to that IP, the internet routing system (BGP – Border Gateway Protocol) automatically directs the request to the **nearest or best-performing server**.

## 1️⃣ How Anycast Works

* Multiple servers (e.g., in New York, London, Tokyo) are configured with the **same IP address**.
* Routers on the internet figure out the **shortest/fastest path** to one of those servers.
* A user in **Japan** will reach the Tokyo server, while a user in **UK** will reach the London server, **even though both use the same IP**.

## 2️⃣ Example of Anycast in Action

* **Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)** 🌐

  * You type a request to `1.1.1.1` in India → Your traffic goes to Cloudflare’s Mumbai server.
  * Someone else in the USA using `1.1.1.1` → Their traffic goes to Cloudflare’s Los Angeles or New York server.
  * Both use the **same IP address**, but reach **different physical servers**.

* **Google DNS (8.8.8.8)** works the same way.

## 3️⃣ Benefits of Anycast ✅

* **Speed** 🚀 – Users are routed to the closest server, reducing latency.
* **Reliability** 🔄 – If one server goes down, traffic is rerouted to the next available one.
* **Load balancing** ⚖️ – Traffic is distributed across multiple servers.
* **DDoS mitigation** 🛡️ – Attack traffic is spread across a global network instead of hitting one server.

## 4️⃣ Anycast vs Unicast vs Multicast 🆚

| Type             | Definition                             | Example                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Unicast** 🎯   | One IP → One specific server           | Your home PC             |
| **Multicast** 📡 | One IP → Many servers at the same time | Live video streaming     |
| **Anycast** 🌍   | One IP → Nearest/best server           | Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) |

## 5️⃣ Real-World Examples 🌟

* **DNS Root Servers** 🌳 – The **13 logical root servers** actually use Anycast with **hundreds of global physical instances**.
* **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** – Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly all use Anycast to serve content faster.
* **Public DNS Providers** – Google DNS (8.8.8.8), Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), Quad9 (9.9.9.9).

✅ **In short:**

> Anycast = **One IP address, many servers, best path routing.**
> It makes the internet **faster, safer, and more resilient**.
