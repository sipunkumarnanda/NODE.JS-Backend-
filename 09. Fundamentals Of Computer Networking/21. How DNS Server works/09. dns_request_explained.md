A **DNS request** (also called a **DNS query**) is a message your computer sends to a **DNS server** asking for information about a domain name, like its IP address.

* **Purpose:** Find out “What is the IP address of `example.com`?”
* **Protocol:** Uses **DNS protocol** over **UDP (port 53)** by default, sometimes TCP (for large responses or DNSSEC).
* **Layer:** Works at the **application layer of the OSI model**, but before web browsing actually starts.

✅ **Example:**
When you type `www.example.com` in your browser → your computer sends a **DNS request** to resolve that domain into an IP (like `93.184.216.34`).

# 🌍 What is an HTTP Request?

An **HTTP request** is what your browser sends to a **web server** once it already knows the IP address of the server.

* **Purpose:** Ask the server for resources (HTML page, image, video, API data, etc.).
* **Protocol:** Uses **HTTP or HTTPS** over **TCP (port 80/443)**.
* **Layer:** Works at the **application layer**, but after DNS resolution has already finished.

✅ **Example:**
Once DNS gives you `93.184.216.34`, your browser connects there and sends:

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

# 🔑 Key Differences Between DNS Request & HTTP Request

| Feature         | DNS Request 🧭                          | HTTP Request 🌐                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose         | Find IP address (or other DNS record)   | Fetch web content from server              |
| Protocol        | DNS (UDP/TCP, port 53)                  | HTTP/HTTPS (TCP, port 80/443)              |
| When it happens | Before connecting to the website        | After DNS resolution, during web browsing  |
| Data returned   | IP address, MX record, TXT record, etc. | Webpage content, JSON data, images, etc.   |
| Example         | “What is the IP of `example.com`?”      | “Send me `/index.html` from `example.com`” |

# 🧭 Flow Example

1. You type `www.example.com` in browser.
2. Browser sends **DNS request** 📨 → gets IP: `93.184.216.34`.
3. Browser then sends **HTTP request** 🌐 → `GET /index.html` to that IP.
4. Server responds with the **webpage content**.

✅ **In short:**

> A **DNS request is NOT the same as an HTTP request**.
> DNS request = “Where is the server?”
> HTTP request = “Now give me the content from that server.”
