When you connect to the internet, your device doesn’t just magically know where to go to access websites. It relies on **IP addresses** and **DNS servers** to find the correct locations. Let’s break this down step by step.

## 1️⃣ IP Addresses Assignment

When your device connects to the internet through an **ISP (Internet Service Provider)**, it is assigned:

* **IPv4 address** 🌍 – A 32-bit address like `192.168.1.1`.
* **IPv6 address** 🌐 – A 128-bit address like `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

These addresses uniquely identify your device on the internet.

At the same time, your ISP assigns **DNS server addresses**:

* **IPv4 DNS server** 🔹 – Used to resolve domain names over IPv4.
* **IPv6 DNS server** 🔹 – Used to resolve domain names over IPv6.

## 2️⃣ What Happens When You Type a Domain Name

Imagine you open your browser and type `xyz.com`. Your device doesn’t understand domain names directly—it only understands **IP addresses**. This is where the **DNS server** comes in.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Query sent to DNS server** 📩
   Your device sends a request to the assigned DNS server, asking:

   > “Hey, what is the IP address of `xyz.com`?”

2. **DNS server searches its records** 🔍

   * If the DNS server **already knows** the IP address (cached), it immediately responds.
   * If not, it queries other DNS servers in a hierarchical manner:

     * Root DNS servers 🌳
     * Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (.com, .org, .net) 🏷️
     * Authoritative DNS servers for `xyz.com` 🏢

3. **IP address returned** ✅
   Once found, the DNS server sends the IP address back to your device.

4. **Browser connects to website** 💻➡️🌐
   Your browser now uses this IP address to connect to the server hosting `xyz.com` and loads the website.

## 3️⃣ Summary

| Term              | Explanation                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IPv4 / IPv6       | Your device’s unique internet address                             |
| DNS server        | Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses          |
| Domain resolution | Process of converting `xyz.com` → `IP address`                    |
| Cache             | Stores recently resolved domain names to speed up future requests |

**In short:** 🌟

> DNS servers act as the **internet’s phonebook**. You search for a name (`xyz.com`), and DNS tells you the exact “phone number” (IP address) to reach it.
