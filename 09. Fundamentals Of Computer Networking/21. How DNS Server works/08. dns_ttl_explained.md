**TTL (Time To Live)** is a value (measured in seconds) that tells DNS resolvers and caches **how long a DNS record should be stored (cached)** before it must be refreshed from the authoritative name server.

Think of it like an **expiration timer** for DNS records.

---

## 1️⃣ Where is TTL Used?

* TTL is defined in **DNS zone files** for each DNS record (A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, etc.).
* It’s returned in every DNS response.
* Caching resolvers (your ISP DNS, Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS, etc.) obey the TTL to know when to discard and re-fetch the record.

---

## 2️⃣ Example of TTL

### DNS Zone File Snippet:

```zone
www   IN   A   93.184.216.34   ; TTL = 3600
```

* `TTL = 3600` → 3600 seconds = **1 hour**
* This means:

  * A resolver that queries `www.example.com` can keep the IP address in cache for **1 hour**.
  * After 1 hour, it must ask the authoritative server again.

## 3️⃣ Why TTL Matters

### ✅ Advantages of High TTL (e.g., 86400 seconds = 24h)

* Reduces load on authoritative servers 🏢
* Faster responses from cache ⚡
* Less DNS traffic across the internet 🌍

### ⚠️ Disadvantages of High TTL

* DNS changes (like IP migration) propagate **slowly** 🐌
* Users may still connect to the old IP until TTL expires

### ✅ Advantages of Low TTL (e.g., 300 seconds = 5 min)

* Changes (IP switch, failover, migration) propagate quickly 🔄
* Useful for planned migrations or DNS-based load balancing

### ⚠️ Disadvantages of Low TTL

* Higher query load on DNS servers 📈
* Slightly slower resolution (less caching benefit)

## 4️⃣ TTL in Action 🔍

When you run a query using `dig`:

```bash
dig www.example.com
```

You might see something like:

```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.example.com.   3600   IN   A   93.184.216.34
```

Here, `3600` is the TTL → means this record is valid in cache for 1 hour.

## 5️⃣ Typical TTL Values Used 📊

* **300 (5 minutes):** Used during migrations or testing
* **3600 (1 hour):** Common default for many domains
* **86400 (24 hours):** Used for stable records (like MX, TXT)

## 6️⃣ TTL Beyond DNS 🌍

TTL is also used in other networking contexts:

* **IP packets** 🛠️ → IP TTL limits how many hops (routers) a packet can take before being discarded.
* **Caching systems** 📦 → TTL defines how long data is kept before refresh.

But in DNS, TTL specifically means **how long a DNS record stays cached**.

✅ **In short:**

> **TTL is the “time-to-live” countdown for DNS records in caches — controlling how quickly changes spread and how much caching happens.**
