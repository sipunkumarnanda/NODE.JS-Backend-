## 3️⃣ Key Differences Between the Two Queries 🆚

| Feature     | `1.1.1.1` (Cloudflare)                  | `8.8.8.8` (Google)                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Speed       | Very fast, optimized for privacy 🌬️    | Reliable, global infrastructure 🌎              |
| Privacy     | Does not log user queries 🔒            | Logs anonymized queries 📊                      |
| Reliability | High, but smaller network than Google ⚡ | Very high, widely used ✅                        |
| Response    | May differ if caches are different 🗄️  | May differ slightly if caches are different 🗄️ |

## 4️⃣ Why Use Different DNS Servers? 🔄

* **Troubleshooting DNS issues**: See if a domain resolves differently on another DNS server.
* **Check propagation**: After changing DNS records, verify updates across multiple servers.
* **Performance testing**: Compare response times between DNS servers.

## 5️⃣ Summary 💡

* `nslookup xyz.com 1.1.1.1` → Queries **Cloudflare DNS**
* `nslookup xyz.com 8.8.8.8` → Queries **Google DNS**
* Both return **IP addresses** of the domain, usually the same, but response times and caching may differ.
* Helps in **DNS troubleshooting** and understanding **how your system resolves domains**.
