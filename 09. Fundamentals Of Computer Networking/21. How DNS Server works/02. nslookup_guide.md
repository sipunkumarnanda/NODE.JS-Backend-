The `nslookup` command is a **network diagnostic tool** used to query **DNS servers** to find details about a domain name or IP address. It helps you see how DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses.

You can run it on **Windows, Linux, or macOS terminals**.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Syntax

```bash
nslookup [domain_name] [dns_server]
```

* `domain_name` üåê ‚Äì The website or domain you want to query (e.g., `xyz.com`).
* `dns_server` üñß (optional) ‚Äì The specific DNS server you want to use for the query.

If no DNS server is specified, your system uses the **default DNS server assigned by your ISP**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Example Command

```bash
nslookup xyz.com
```

### Sample Output

```
Server:  dns.isp.com
Address:  192.168.1.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    xyz.com
Address: 93.184.216.34
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Explanation of Each Line

### **Server:**

```
Server:  dns.isp.com
```

* This shows the **DNS server** your system used to perform the query.
* Usually, it‚Äôs the one assigned by your ISP.

---

### **Address:**

```
Address:  192.168.1.1
```

* The **IP address** of the DNS server that responded to your query.

---

### **Non-authoritative answer:**

```
Non-authoritative answer:
```

* Indicates that the response **did not come directly from the authoritative DNS server** of `xyz.com`.
* Instead, the DNS server you queried provided the IP from its **cache**.

> If it said **Authoritative answer**, it means the DNS server has the final, official information for that domain.

---

### **Name and Address:**

```
Name:    xyz.com
Address: 93.184.216.34
```

* **Name:** The domain you queried.
* **Address:** The resolved IP address of the domain.
* Your browser will use this IP to connect to the website.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Querying a Specific DNS Server

You can also query a particular DNS server directly:

```bash
nslookup xyz.com 8.8.8.8
```

* Here, `8.8.8.8` is **Google‚Äôs public DNS server**.
* The output format is similar, but the response may be faster or more reliable depending on the server.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Using `nslookup` in Interactive Mode

Typing just `nslookup` in the terminal enters **interactive mode**:

```bash
> nslookup
Default Server:  dns.isp.com
Address:  192.168.1.1
> xyz.com
> google.com
> exit
```

* This allows you to query **multiple domains without retyping the command** every time.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways

* `nslookup` helps **debug DNS issues**.
* Shows whether DNS is resolving domains correctly.
* Distinguishes between **authoritative and non-authoritative responses**.
* Can query **specific DNS servers** for troubleshooting.
