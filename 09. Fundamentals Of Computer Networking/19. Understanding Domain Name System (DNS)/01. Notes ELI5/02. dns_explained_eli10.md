Imagine you want to call your friend 📞, but you don’t remember their number — only their name.
You look up the number in a phonebook.

That’s what DNS does: it takes a **name** (like `www.google.com`) and finds the **number (IP address)** so your computer can talk to it.

# 🔎 DNS name parts — labels & dots

A domain name has **parts** separated by dots (`.`).
Example: `www.google.com.`

Read it **right → left**:

* `. (dot at the end)` = **Root** (the boss of everything)
* `com` = **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** (a big category)
* `google` = **Second-Level Domain (SLD)** (the name Google bought)
* `www` = **Subdomain / Third Level** (a “nickname” Google uses)

```
www    .   google    .   com    .   (root)
sub    2nd           TLD        Root
```

# 🧩 Who owns what?

* **Root (.)** = run by ICANN/IANA + big organizations worldwide
* **TLD (.com)** = run by **Verisign** (they manage the `.com` list)
* **SLD (google.com)** = owned by **Google LLC**
* **Subdomain (www)** = chosen & controlled by Google

---

# 🧭 How your computer finds `www.google.com`

1. Your computer checks if it already knows (cache).
2. If not, it asks a **resolver** (like your ISP or Google DNS).
3. The resolver starts from the **root**:

   * Root says: “Ask `.com` servers.”
   * `.com` servers say: “Ask Google’s servers.”
   * Google’s servers say: “Here’s the IP for `www.google.com` → 142.250.x.x.”
4. Now your computer connects directly to that IP. 🎉

# 🧾 DNS record types (like entries in the phonebook)

* **A** → IPv4 address (number)
* **AAAA** → IPv6 address (newer, bigger numbers)
* **CNAME** → nickname pointing to another name
* **NS** → nameservers (who to ask)
* **SOA** → info about the zone (like version number)
* **MX** → mail servers (for email)
* **TXT** → random text (used for security stuff like SPF/DKIM)

Example (simplified):

```
google.com → NS = ns1.google.com
www.google.com → A = 142.250.190.4
```

# 🔗 Delegation & Glue (helping directions)

* Parent zone (like `.com`) points to child zone (`google.com`) using **NS records**.
* If the child’s server is inside its own zone (like `ns1.google.com`), the parent must also give the IP. That’s called **glue** so you don’t get stuck in a loop.

# 🏛️ Registries, Registrars, Registrants

Think of it like house ownership 🏠:

* **Registry** = land office (keeps the master list for a TLD)
* **Registrar** = real estate agent (sells domains to people)
* **Registrant** = the person/company who buys it (the real owner)

Example:

* Registry for `.com` = Verisign
* Registrar you use = GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains
* Registrant of `google.com` = Google LLC

---

# 💸 Domain brokers & aftermarket

Sometimes, the domain you want is **already owned**.

* A **domain broker** helps you buy it secretly or negotiate a deal.
* There are marketplaces like Sedo, Afternic, GoDaddy Auctions.
* Payment often goes through **escrow** (trusted middleman) so nobody gets scammed.

# 🛡️ DNS security

* **DNS spoofing**: bad guys give you the wrong IP.

  * Fix: **DNSSEC** (signs answers so you know they’re real).
* **DoT / DoH**: encrypt your DNS queries so nobody spies.
* **Registrar lock + 2FA**: stop thieves from stealing your domain.
* **WHOIS privacy**: hides your personal info.

# 🛠️ Useful commands

* `dig www.google.com` → find the IP
* `dig +trace www.google.com` → follow step by step (root → TLD → Google)
* `nslookup` and `host` → also DNS tools

---

# 🔁 Example trace: `www.google.com`

1. Ask root: “Where is `.com`?”
2. Root: “Here’s `.com`’s servers.”
3. Ask `.com`: “Where is `google.com`?”
4. `.com`: “Here’s Google’s servers.”
5. Ask Google: “Where is `www.google.com`?”
6. Google: “It’s 142.250.190.4.”

Done ✅

# ✅ Managing your own domain (checklist)

* Buy a domain via a registrar
* Set nameservers (Cloudflare, Route53, etc.)
* Add records (A for website, MX for email, TXT for verification)
* Use DNSSEC + lock + 2FA for safety
* If expired, it may go to auction or backorder

# 🎯 Final ELI10 picture

* Root (.) = 🌍 World’s boss
* `.com` = 🏢 A giant floor in the Internet building
* `google` = 📖 Google’s book on that floor
* `www` = 🔖 A chapter in the book
* DNS = 📚 The librarian who finds the right page (IP address) for you
