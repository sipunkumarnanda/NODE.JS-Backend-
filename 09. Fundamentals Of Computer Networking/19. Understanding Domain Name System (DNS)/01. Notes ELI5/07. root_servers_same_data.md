1. **Root Zone Data**

   * Every root server holds a **copy of the root zone**, which contains:

     * **NS records** for all TLDs (like `.com`, `.org`, `.uk`)
     * **Glue records** (IP addresses of TLD nameservers)
     * **SOA record** (metadata about the root zone)

2. **Consistency**

   * The data is **identical across all root servers** because they are all authoritative for the **root zone**.
   * Updates are **coordinated by IANA** and distributed via Verisign.

3. **Anycast Copies**

   * Each named root server (e.g., `a.root-servers.net`) has **hundreds of physical instances worldwide**.
   * All those instances also have the **same root zone data** for consistency.

4. **Why identical?**

   * So that **no matter which root server a resolver queries**, the answer for a TLD is **always the same**.
   * Guarantees **reliability, trust, and consistency** across the Internet.

### ✅ Analogy

* Imagine **13 copies of the same master library catalog** (root zone).
* Each copy is kept in a different city.
* No matter which librarian you ask, you get **the exact same list of books**.

So in short:

> **All 13 root servers have the same root zone data**, just served from different locations to improve performance, reliability, and security.
