The **root zone** is the **topmost layer** of the DNS hierarchy. Every DNS lookup starts here.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Root Zone?

* The **root zone** is a **database of all Top-Level Domains (TLDs)** ‚Äî like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, country-code TLDs like `.uk`, `.jp`, and new TLDs like `.xyz`.
* It does **not contain IPs for websites**, only **delegation information** for TLDs.

### Contents of the Root Zone

1. **NS Records** ‚Äì Delegation of authority to TLD servers:

   * Example:

     ```
     com.   NS   a.gtld-servers.net.
     com.   NS   b.gtld-servers.net.
     ```
   * Meaning: ‚ÄúIf you want `.com`, ask these nameservers.‚Äù

2. **Glue Records** ‚Äì IP addresses for nameservers that are part of the TLD zone:

   * Example:

     ```
     a.gtld-servers.net. A 192.5.6.30
     ```
   * Meaning: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the IP to reach this nameserver, so no circular lookup is needed.‚Äù

3. **SOA Record** ‚Äì Start of Authority for the root:

   * Provides metadata like serial number, refresh/retry times, TTL, and the email of the administrator.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How the Root Zone is Managed

* **IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)**:

  * Maintains the official **root zone database**.
  * Decides which TLDs exist.
  * Publishes updates to the root zone.

* **Verisign**:

  * Technically operates and distributes the root zone file.
  * Ensures updates reach all root servers.

* **Root Zone Changes**:

  * Adding/removing TLDs goes through a **review process** by ICANN and IANA.
  * Signed via **DNSSEC** for authenticity.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Root Servers ‚Äî The Gatekeepers

Root servers are the **machines that serve the root zone to the world**.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

* There are **13 named root servers (A‚ÄìM)**.
* Each ‚Äúroot server name‚Äù is **mirrored worldwide** via **anycast**, resulting in **1,500+ physical instances**.
* Function: They **only answer queries about TLDs**, not specific domains like `google.com`.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Operators of Root Servers

| Root | Operator                          |
| ---- | --------------------------------- |
| A    | Verisign                          |
| B    | USC/ISI                           |
| C    | Cogent                            |
| D    | University of Maryland            |
| E    | NASA Ames                         |
| F    | ISC                               |
| G    | US DOD Network Information Center |
| H    | US Army Research Lab              |
| I    | Netnod                            |
| J    | Verisign                          |
| K    | RIPE NCC                          |
| L    | ICANN                             |
| M    | WIDE Project (Japan)              |

* Each operator runs multiple **anycast instances** for resilience and performance.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How Root Servers Work in DNS Resolution

Example: Resolving `www.google.com`

1. Resolver asks a **root server**: ‚ÄúWho is authoritative for `.com`?‚Äù
2. Root server responds with a list of **`.com` TLD nameservers** and glue IPs.
3. Resolver asks a `.com` nameserver: ‚ÄúWho handles `google.com`?‚Äù
4. `.com` replies with **Google‚Äôs authoritative nameservers**.
5. Resolver queries Google: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the IP for `www.google.com`?‚Äù
6. Google‚Äôs server responds with the final **A/AAAA record**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Resilience

1. **DNSSEC**:

   * Root zone is **signed** to ensure authenticity.
   * Acts as the **trust anchor** for validating all lower zones.

2. **Anycast Distribution**:

   * Copies of each root server exist globally.
   * Ensures **low latency** and **DDoS protection**.

3. **Multi-operator Model**:

   * 12 different organizations operate the 13 root identities.
   * Reduces **single points of failure**.

4. **Root Key Signing Ceremony**:

   * ICANN performs public ceremonies to generate and protect root zone cryptographic keys.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways

* **Root Zone**:

  * Database of all TLDs.
  * Contains NS records, glue, and SOA.
  * Managed by IANA and Verisign.

* **Root Servers**:

  * Serve the root zone to the Internet.
  * 13 named servers (A‚ÄìM), thousands of anycast instances.
  * Only answer TLD queries, not full domain queries.
  * Secure, redundant, and globally distributed.

* Without the **root zone and root servers**, **no DNS resolution would work**. They are the anchor of trust and the starting point of every Internet lookup.

# Do root zones reside inside root servers?

Not exactly ‚Äî it‚Äôs close, but let me clarify carefully so there‚Äôs no confusion. ‚úÖ

# üîπ Relationship Between Root Zone and Root Servers

1. **Root Zone**:

   * The **root zone** is a **database/file**.
   * It contains the **list of all TLDs**, NS records, glue records, and SOA.
   * Think of it like a **master index or directory** of the Internet‚Äôs top-level domains.
   * **It does not ‚Äúlive‚Äù on one computer** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a piece of data that can be copied everywhere.

2. **Root Servers**:

   * Root servers are **computers (or clusters) that serve the root zone to the Internet**.
   * Each root server has a **copy of the root zone** (or can retrieve it from the official source).
   * There are **13 named root servers (A‚ÄìM)**, each with many **anycast instances worldwide**.

3. **How it works together**:

   * IANA maintains the **official root zone file**.
   * Verisign distributes it.
   * Root servers **load this root zone** and respond to DNS queries asking about TLDs.
   * When you ask a root server, it doesn‚Äôt generate answers on the fly ‚Äî it looks up in its **copy of the root zone** and replies.

---

### ‚úÖ Analogy

* **Root Zone** = a printed master directory of all library sections (TLDs) üìñ
* **Root Server** = a librarian who **carries a copy of that directory** and answers questions:

  * ‚ÄúWhere is the `.com` section?‚Äù ‚Üí Librarian checks the directory and replies.
* Multiple librarians (root servers) have copies of the same directory all over the world.

---

So, in short:

* **Root zone = the data**
* **Root servers = the computers serving that data**

The root zone doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlive‚Äù in one root server ‚Äî it‚Äôs **replicated to all root servers** for speed, reliability, and redundancy.
