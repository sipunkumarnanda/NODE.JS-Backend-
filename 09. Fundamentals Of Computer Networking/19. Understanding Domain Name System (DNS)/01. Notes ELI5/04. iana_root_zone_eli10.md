Think of the Internet like a **giant library of websites** 📚.

* Every website has a name (like `www.google.com`).
* But how does your computer know where to find it?
* At the very **top of the Internet library** is the **Root Zone** — the master list of all the “big sections” called **TLDs** (like `.com`, `.org`, `.uk`).

---

# 📄 What’s inside the Root Zone?

The root zone is like a **directory with directions**:

1. **NS records** → “These are the servers in charge of `.com` or `.org`.”
2. **Glue records** → the actual **addresses (IP numbers)** of those servers, so your computer can reach them.

Example (simplified):

```
com.   NS   a.gtld-servers.net.
com.   NS   b.gtld-servers.net.
com.   A    192.5.6.30   ; this is glue (IP address)
```

* `.` on the left = root zone
* NS = “these are the nameservers you ask for `.com`”
* A (glue) = “here’s where the nameserver lives”

# 🧾 Who runs the root servers?

There are **13 main root server names** (A–M), but each one is **copied many times all over the world** 🌎.

Some examples:

| Root               | Operated by            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| a.root-servers.net | Verisign               |
| b.root-servers.net | USC/ISI                |
| c.root-servers.net | Cogent                 |
| d.root-servers.net | University of Maryland |
| e.root-servers.net | NASA Ames              |
| f.root-servers.net | ISC                    |
| k.root-servers.net | RIPE NCC               |
| l.root-servers.net | ICANN                  |
| m.root-servers.net | WIDE Project (Japan)   |

> Think of them as **librarians in different cities** who all have the same master list.

# 🔍 How your computer uses it

When you type `www.google.com`:

1. Your computer asks a **root server**: “Where are the `.com` servers?”
2. The root server says: “Here’s a list of `.com` servers (with IPs).”
3. Your computer asks a `.com` server: “Where is `google.com`?”
4. `.com` replies: “Ask Google’s servers.”
5. Your computer asks Google’s server: “What’s the IP for `www.google.com`?”
6. Google replies: “Here it is → 142.250.190.4.”

✅ Now your computer can go to the website!

# 📝 Why it’s important

* Without the root zone, your computer wouldn’t know where to start looking.
* It’s **the Internet’s master list of all TLDs**.
* Each root server is like a **trusted librarian**.
* “Glue” ensures your computer can actually **reach the librarian**.

# 🌟 Summary (ELI10)

* **Root zone** = top-level “Internet library index” 📚
* **NS records** = directions to TLD librarians 🧭
* **Glue (A/AAAA)** = the addresses so you can reach them 🏠
* **Root servers** = librarians worldwide who answer questions 🌍
* Computers ask root → TLD → domain → subdomain to find websites.
