1. **Performance / Low Latency** ⏱️

   * If there was only **one root server**, every DNS query from anywhere in the world would have to travel to that server.
   * That would be **slow**, especially for users far away (e.g., Australia → US).
   * By having **many copies**, queries are answered **locally**, much faster.

2. **Redundancy / Reliability** 🛡️

   * Computers can fail. Networks can go down.
   * If one root server goes offline, **others can take over**.
   * Multiple copies ensure the **Internet keeps working even if some servers fail**.

3. **DDoS Protection / Security** 🔐

   * Root servers are **high-value targets** for attacks.
   * Anycast copies allow traffic to be **spread across many locations**, so an attack against one copy doesn’t take down the whole system.

4. **Global Accessibility** 🌐

   * Users everywhere (Africa, Asia, Europe, Americas) can reach a **nearby root server** instead of crossing oceans.
   * Improves speed and ensures **everyone can resolve DNS reliably**.

5. **Anycast Technology** 🚀

   * Each root server name (like `a.root-servers.net`) is **mirrored** in hundreds of locations using **anycast**.
   * Computers sending queries automatically reach the **closest server copy**.

### ✅ Analogy

* Think of **root servers** as **libraries with the master index of all books**.
* If there was only one library in New York, someone in Tokyo would wait hours to get an answer.
* Instead, there are **copies of the library in many cities**, so everyone can check **locally** — faster and safer.

So in short:

> **1,500+ copies worldwide = faster DNS, more reliable, globally accessible, and resistant to attacks.**
