* The **IANA Root Zone File** is publicly available. It lists all TLD delegations (i.e. which nameservers are authoritative for each TLD) plus glue records where needed. ([IANA][1])
* DNS resolver software (like BIND) often includes a ‚Äúroot hints file‚Äù (sometimes called `named.root`) that seeds the list of root server names & IPs so that resolvers can bootstrap the DNS process. ([bind9.readthedocs.io][2])

Here‚Äôs a truncated example of how part of the root zone file might look (NOT full, but illustrative):

```
; Root zone file excerpt (simplified)
; (This is not complete ‚Äî just to show structure)

; SOA (Start of Authority) for the root
.   3600000  IN  SOA   a.root-servers.net. nstld.verisign-grs.com. (
                 2025092901 ; serial
                 1800       ; refresh
                 900        ; retry
                 604800     ; expire
                 86400      ; minimum TTL
)

; NS records: delegation of TLDs from root
.   172800    IN  NS    a.root-servers.net.
.   172800    IN  NS    b.root-servers.net.
.   172800    IN  NS    c.root-servers.net.
‚Ä¶ (through m.root-servers.net) ‚Ä¶

; Glue / A / AAAA records for root servers (IPs of root servers)
a.root-servers.net.   172800  IN  A     198.41.0.4
a.root-servers.net.   172800  IN  AAAA  2001:503:BA3E::2:30
b.root-servers.net.   172800  IN  A     199.9.14.201
b.root-servers.net.   172800  IN  AAAA  2001:500:200::B
‚Ä¶ etc. ‚Ä¶
```

* The `.` on the leftmost side means the root zone (empty label).
* The **SOA** record is the root‚Äôs authoritative metadata: who is responsible, email, serial number, timers (refresh/retry/expire).
* NS records list the root‚Äôs nameservers (a-root, b-root, ‚Ä¶ m-root).
* Glue / A / AAAA records tie names like `a.root-servers.net.` to actual IP addresses so resolvers can contact them.

In the real root zone file, there are **delegations for all TLDs** (hundreds to thousands), plus their nameservers. ([IANA][1])

## üßæ Root Servers: names & operators

From IANA‚Äôs "Root Servers" listing, you get the root servers and their IPs. ([IANA][3])

Some examples:

* `a.root-servers.net` ‚Äî operated by **Verisign**
* `b.root-servers.net` ‚Äî USC/ISI
* `c.root-servers.net` ‚Äî Cogent
* `d.root-servers.net` ‚Äî University of Maryland
* `e.root-servers.net` ‚Äî NASA Ames
* `f.root-servers.net` ‚Äî ISC
* `k.root-servers.net` ‚Äî RIPE NCC
* `l.root-servers.net` ‚Äî ICANN
* `m.root-servers.net` ‚Äî WIDE Project
  (And others) ([NsLookup.io][4])

Each of those root server names in the NS records has one or more IP addresses (IPv4, IPv6) in the root zone file (i.e. glue) so that resolvers can send queries to them.

## üîç How resolvers use this snippet / root hints

* A DNS resolver uses its **root hints file** (derived from IANA‚Äôs root zone file / hints listing) to know *where* root servers live (IP addresses + names).
* The resolver sends a query to one of those root server IPs asking for NS records for a TLD (e.g. ‚Äú.com‚Äù).
* The root server answers listing which nameservers are authoritative for `.com` (plus glue IPs if needed).
* The resolver proceeds downward (to TLD, then to domain).
