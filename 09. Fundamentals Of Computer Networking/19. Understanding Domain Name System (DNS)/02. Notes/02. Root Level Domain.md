* The **Root** is the **highest level** in the DNS hierarchy.
* It is represented by an **empty label** (a blank string), shown in fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) as a **trailing dot (`.`)**.

  * Example: `www.google.com.` ← the last dot means “this is the root.”
* Every DNS lookup technically ends at the root — it’s the starting point of delegation.

So in the hierarchy:

```
www.google.com.
                ↑
              (root)
```

# 🗂️ Structure of the Root

* The root is a **single zone** called the **root zone**.
* It contains **delegation records** for every Top-Level Domain (TLD), like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.uk`, `.jp`, etc.
* What’s inside the root zone:

  * **NS records** (pointing to authoritative servers for each TLD)
  * **Glue records** (IP addresses of those TLD nameservers, so they can be reached directly)

👉 Example (simplified record from the root zone):

```
com.   NS   a.gtld-servers.net.
com.   NS   b.gtld-servers.net.
com.   NS   c.gtld-servers.net.
com.   A    192.5.6.30   ; glue
```

# 🏛️ Who manages the root?

The root is critical infrastructure, so it is managed jointly:

1. **IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)** — part of **ICANN** (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers):

   * Maintains the **root zone database** (the authoritative list of TLDs and their operators).
   * Decides which TLDs exist (like `.com`, `.org`, `.xyz`, country codes, etc.).
2. **Verisign**:

   * Maintains the **root zone file** technically (publishes it).
   * Distributes it to root servers.
3. **Root Server Operators**:

   * 12 independent organizations run the **13 root server identities** (A–M).
   * Each “identity” is heavily distributed worldwide with **Anycast** networks.
   * Example operators: Verisign (A & J root), University of Maryland, RIPE NCC, ICANN, NASA Ames, etc.

# 🛰️ The Root Servers

* There are **13 root server identities**: A-root, B-root, C-root … M-root.
* Each is **mirrored globally** via anycast → in reality, there are **over 1,500+ root server instances** across continents.
* Their job: respond to queries about **TLDs** (not specific domain names).

Example query flow:

* Resolver asks root: “Where is `.com`?”
* Root replies: “Here are the `.com` nameservers.”

# 🔄 Why is the root needed?

Without the root:

* There would be no way to know who runs `.com`, `.org`, `.uk`, etc.
* The root is the **anchor of trust** in DNS — the starting point for every resolution.

It ensures:

* **Delegation chain** exists from root → TLD → SLD → subdomains.
* **DNSSEC trust anchor**: The root is signed with DNSSEC, and validating resolvers use the root’s public key as the anchor of verification.

# 📜 Root domain vs Root servers vs Root zone

* **Root domain (.)** = the topmost empty label in DNS hierarchy.
* **Root zone** = the database of delegations maintained by IANA & Verisign, listing all TLDs.
* **Root servers** = physical/logical servers that serve the root zone worldwide.

# 🧩 Example: Resolution using root

Resolving `www.google.com.`

1. Resolver asks **root server**: “Who is authoritative for `.com`?”

   * Root replies: “Here are the `.com` NS servers.”
2. Resolver asks a `.com` nameserver: “Who is authoritative for `google.com`?”

   * `.com` NS replies with Google’s nameservers.
3. Resolver asks Google’s nameserver: “What’s the A record for `www.google.com`?”

   * Answer: `142.250.190.4`

# 🔐 Security of the root

* **DNSSEC**: Root zone is signed → establishes the **global trust anchor**.
* **Diversity of operators**: Root servers are run by multiple organizations worldwide → reduces single point of failure.
* **Anycast**: Copies of each root are deployed globally for resilience and performance.
* **Root Key Signing Ceremony**: ICANN holds public key ceremonies a few times a year to generate and securely store the DNSSEC root keys.

# ⚖️ Ownership & Neutrality

* No company **owns** the root; it is a **shared global resource**.
* IANA (ICANN) coordinates; Verisign operates the root zone file; 12 orgs run the root servers.
* Governments, ISPs, and end-users rely on it — so governance is designed to be **multi-stakeholder and neutral**.

---

# 🌟 In summary

* The **Root Level Domain (.)** is the **invisible top** of every domain name.
* It’s the **directory of TLDs**, not of individual sites.
* Managed by **IANA/ICANN & Verisign**, served by **root servers worldwide**.
* It’s the **first step of every DNS resolution** and the **trust anchor for DNSSEC**.
