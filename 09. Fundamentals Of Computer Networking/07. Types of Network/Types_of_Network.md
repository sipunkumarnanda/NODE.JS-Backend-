
# 🌐 Types of Networks (Explained with Examples)

---

## ✅ 1. **LAN – Local Area Network**

### 📌 Definition:

A **LAN (Local Area Network)** connects computers and devices within a **small geographical area** such as:

* Home
* School
* Office building
* Cafe

### 🔧 Characteristics:

* High speed (100 Mbps to 10 Gbps)
* Private ownership
* Limited range (typically under 1 km)
* Usually uses Ethernet or Wi-Fi

### 📘 Example:

* Your home Wi-Fi network
* A company office with 20 computers and a shared printer

## ✅ 2. **MAN – Metropolitan Area Network**

### 📌 Definition:

A **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** spans a **city or large campus**. It connects multiple LANs together.

### 🔧 Characteristics:

* Covers areas from 5 km to 50 km
* Higher speed than WAN but lower than LAN
* Often managed by telecom companies or ISPs

### 📘 Example:

* A bank with branches across a city
* City-wide government network connecting police, hospitals, fire stations

## ✅ 3. **WAN – Wide Area Network**

### 📌 Definition:

A **WAN (Wide Area Network)** covers a **large geographic area**, often countries or continents. It connects multiple LANs and MANs.

### 🔧 Characteristics:

* Lower speed (compared to LAN)
* Often uses public infrastructure like satellites or undersea cables
* Can be private or public (e.g., the internet)

### 📘 Example:

* The Internet itself
* A multinational company's global network (e.g., Google’s internal backbone)

## ✅ 4. **CAN – Campus Area Network**

### 📌 Definition:

A **CAN (Campus Area Network)** connects networks within a **specific campus or group of buildings** such as:

* University campus
* Military base
* Industrial plant

### 🔧 Characteristics:

* Larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN
* High-speed and controlled by a single organization

### 📘 Example:

* A university network connecting hostels, libraries, labs, and admin blocks
* A large company with multiple buildings in one area

## ✅ 5. **PAN – Personal Area Network**

### 📌 Definition:

A **PAN (Personal Area Network)** is a **very small network** used for **personal devices** in close range (typically within 10 meters).

### 🔧 Characteristics:

* Short-range
* Bluetooth, Infrared, or USB
* Low power and limited data

### 📘 Example:

* Connecting your smartphone to Bluetooth headphones
* A smartwatch synced to your phone

## ✅ 6. **BAN – Body Area Network**

### 📌 Definition:

A **BAN (Body Area Network)** connects **wearable computing devices** on or around the human body.

### 🔧 Characteristics:

* Used in healthcare and fitness
* Short-range (within or around the body)
* Often includes sensors

### 📘 Example:

* Heart-rate monitor + fitness tracker + smartphone + insulin pump
* Medical devices sending health data to a doctor’s app

---

## ✅ 7. **SAN – Storage Area Network**

### 📌 Definition:

A **SAN (Storage Area Network)** is a **specialized network** that provides **access to high-speed storage devices**, separate from the main local network.

### 🔧 Characteristics:

* Used in enterprise data centers
* Provides block-level storage
* High reliability and performance

### 📘 Example:

* A data center using a SAN to connect multiple servers to a shared disk array

---

### 🧊 Related Concept: NAS (Network Attached Storage)

* **NAS (Network Attached Storage)** is similar to SAN but works at **file level**, not block level.
* A NAS device is like a shared folder for multiple users over the network.

**Example:**

* A home NAS (like Synology) storing movies, backups, and photos accessible from all your devices
