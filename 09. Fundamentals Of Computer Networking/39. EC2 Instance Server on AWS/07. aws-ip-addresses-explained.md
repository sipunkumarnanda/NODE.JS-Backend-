I'll explain what **Public IPv4**, **Public DNS**, and **Elastic (static) IPs** are, whether they cost money, and exactly **how to allocate/associate/disassociate/release** an Elastic IP ‚Äî with clear steps and what happens at each stage. I cite AWS docs for the most important points. ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 1. Public IPv4 vs Public DNS ‚Äî what‚Äôs the difference? üÜîüî§

* **Public IPv4 address**: an IPv4 address assigned to an instance that is reachable from the internet (e.g., `198.51.100.25`). This is what clients contact directly. ([AWS Documentation][1])
* **Public DNS name**: a hostname (like `ec2-198-51-100-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com`) that resolves to the instance‚Äôs public IPv4 outside the instance (or to the private IP inside the VPC). The DNS name is just a convenient name that points to the public IP. You can use either the IP (A record) or the DNS name (CNAME) for domain mapping. ([AWS Documentation][2])

**Key behavior to know:** a default *public IPv4* assigned automatically at instance launch is **ephemeral** ‚Äî if you stop and start the instance (not reboot), that automatic public IP can change. The public DNS will reflect whatever public IP is currently assigned. ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 2. What is an Elastic IP (EIP)? ‚Äî static IPv4 you control üß≤

* An **Elastic IP** is a *static* IPv4 address allocated to your AWS account in a specific Region. You **allocate** it to your account and then **associate** it with an instance or a network interface; it remains yours until you **release** it. Use it when you need a fixed IP (for DNS A records, stable endpoints, or failover). ([AWS Documentation][3])

**Why use EIP?**

* Keeps the same IP across instance stop/start cycles.
* Lets you remap the IP quickly to another instance to mask failures. ([AWS Documentation][3])

## 3. Is a Public IPv4 / Elastic IP free? (short answer + nuance) üí∏

* **Public IPv4 (automatic assigned)**: AWS updated the Free Tier (Feb 1, 2024) to include **750 hours/month** of public IPv4 address usage for the first 12 months for new Free Tier customers ‚Äî this covers running an instance with a public IP without extra IP-hour charges. However, this only describes free-tier public IP allowances ‚Äî not all scenarios. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][4])
* **Elastic IPs**: AWS **may charge** for Elastic IP addresses in some situations. Common rules (see pricing docs): you are typically **charged** for Elastic IPs that are allocated to your account but **not associated** with a running instance (idle), and for additional EIPs beyond the first associated one per instance in many cases. In short ‚Äî an EIP *can* be free while in normal used/attached state but AWS billing rules make idle or excess EIPs billable. Always check the current VPC/pricing page for exact rates. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][5])

**Practical advice for trial use:** If you only need a public IP while your instance runs and you don't require it to persist across stop/start, using the instance's automatically assigned public IPv4 (covered by Free Tier hours) is simplest. If you need a fixed IP for DNS mapping during the trial, allocate an Elastic IP but **release it when done** to avoid idle charges. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][4])

## 4. How to use an Elastic IP ‚Äî allocate ‚Üí associate ‚Üí disassociate ‚Üí release (step-by-step) üîÅ

All steps can be done via the **EC2 Console**, **AWS CLI**, or SDK. Below are console steps (what happens at each step) with the corresponding doc references.

### A. Allocate an Elastic IP (reserve it to your account)

**Console steps**

1. Go to **EC2 Console ‚Üí Network & Security ‚Üí Elastic IPs ‚Üí Allocate Elastic IP address ‚Üí Allocate**.
2. AWS assigns an available IPv4 address to your account (you now "own" it in that Region).

**What happens:** AWS takes an IP from its pool and records it against your account (`allocation-id`). It‚Äôs reserved for you until you release it. If you leave it unassociated, AWS may charge for idle EIPs. ([AWS Documentation][6])

### B. Associate an Elastic IP with an instance (make it live)

**Console steps**

1. Select the EIP ‚Üí **Actions ‚Üí Associate Elastic IP address**.
2. Choose **Resource type = Instance** (or Network Interface), then select the instance. Confirm.

**What happens:** The EIP is attached to the instance‚Äôs primary network interface; any previous automatically assigned public IPv4 is released back to Amazon‚Äôs pool. Your instance now responds at the EIP (and its public DNS resolves to that IP). ([AWS Documentation][7])

### C. Disassociate an Elastic IP (remove from instance but keep reserved)

**Console steps**

1. EC2 Console ‚Üí Elastic IPs ‚Üí select EIP ‚Üí **Actions ‚Üí Disassociate Elastic IP address ‚Üí Disassociate**.

**What happens:** The EIP stops pointing at the instance, but remains allocated to your account. If you leave it allocated but unassociated, AWS may charge for the idle EIP ‚Äî so disassociate only if you plan to re-associate soon or immediately release if you don‚Äôt need it. ([AWS Documentation][7])

### D. Release an Elastic IP (give it back to AWS)

**Console steps**

1. EC2 Console ‚Üí Elastic IPs ‚Üí select the EIP (must be disassociated) ‚Üí **Actions ‚Üí Release Elastic IP addresses ‚Üí Release**.

**What happens:** The IP is removed from your account and returned to Amazon‚Äôs pool. You stop being charged (if any), and you might not be able to get the same IP again. Use this when you‚Äôre done (e.g., end of trial). ([AWS Documentation][8])

## 5. Example CLI commands (quick) üñ•Ô∏è

* Allocate:

```bash
aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc
# returns AllocationId (eipalloc-...)
```

* Associate:

```bash
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id i-0123456789abcdef0 --allocation-id eipalloc-01234567
```

* Disassociate:

```bash
aws ec2 disassociate-address --association-id eipassoc-01234567
```

* Release:

```bash
aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id eipalloc-01234567
```

(See AWS docs for exact CLI flags and returned IDs.) ([AWS Documentation][7])

## 6. Important operational notes & best practices ‚úÖ

* **Ephemeral public IPs change** on stop/start; use Elastic IP if you need a stable IP for DNS records. ([AWS Documentation][1])
* **Charges:** Don‚Äôt leave Elastic IPs allocated and unused ‚Äî that‚Äôs a common source of unexpected charges. Release EIPs when you no longer need them. Check the VPC/EIP pricing page for current rates. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][5])
* **DNS records:** For production, point your domain‚Äôs A record to the Elastic IP (or use Route¬†53 alias records to a load balancer). If you associate an EIP to a different instance, update DNS or use Route¬†53 TTLs wisely. ([AWS Documentation][3])
* **Region scope:** Elastic IPs are region-specific ‚Äî you can‚Äôt move an EIP between regions. ([AWS Documentation][3])

## 7. TL;DR ‚Äî Quick checklist for trial users üßæ

* If you just want to test a server for a short time: launch EC2 with the **automatic public IPv4** (covered by Free Tier hours) ‚Äî simpler and typically free during the first 12 months. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][4])
* If you need a **stable IP (for DNS)** during the trial, **allocate an Elastic IP**, **associate** it to your instance, and **release** it when done to avoid idle charges. ([AWS Documentation][6])
* Always double-check **current AWS pricing** for EIPs and public IPv4 usage on the AWS pricing pages before depending on them for long-running workloads. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][5])
