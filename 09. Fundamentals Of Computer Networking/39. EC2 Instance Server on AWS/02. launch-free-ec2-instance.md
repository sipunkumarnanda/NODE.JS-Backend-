This guide explains **how to launch a free-tier EC2 instance**, step by step, **what happens at each stage**, and important tips for beginners. Follow along to understand the process **in depth**.

---

## ☁️ 1. What is an EC2 instance?

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a virtual server in the cloud. You can:

* Run websites, apps, or scripts
* Access it via SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows)
* Scale resources as needed

**Free tier** allows:

* **t2.micro or t3.micro instance**
* **750 hours per month** (enough to run 1 instance continuously)
* Includes **30 GB EBS storage**, and limited bandwidth

---

## 🔑 2. Prerequisites

Before launching:

1. **AWS account** (IAM user or root)
2. **IAM user with EC2 full access**
3. **SSH key pair** (for Linux instance)
4. Knowledge of **VPC, subnet, and security groups** (we’ll cover basics)

---

## 🛣️ 3. Step 1 — Open EC2 Dashboard

1. Log in to **AWS Management Console** → select **EC2** from services.
2. You’ll see **EC2 Dashboard**, which shows:

   * Running instances
   * Security groups
   * Key pairs

> EC2 Dashboard is the central control panel for your virtual servers.

## 🖥️ 4. Step 2 — Launch Instance

1. Click **Launch Instances**.
2. Fill in the instance details:

| Field                          | What it means       | Notes                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                       | Instance identifier | Give a descriptive name, e.g., `MyFreeServer`      |
| **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** | OS template         | Choose **Amazon Linux 2 AMI (Free tier eligible)** |
| **Instance Type**              | CPU & memory        | Select **t2.micro** (free tier)                    |
| **Key pair**                   | SSH key             | Select existing or create new one for secure login |

### 🔍 What happens here:

* **AMI** is like a pre-built OS + software image
* **Instance type** determines CPU, memory, and network resources
* **Key pair** allows secure SSH login (private key stays with you, public key goes to AWS)

## 🌐 5. Step 3 — Configure Network & Security

1. Choose a **VPC** (default is fine for beginners)
2. Select a **subnet** (default also fine)
3. Auto-assign **public IP**: Enable (so you can access instance from internet)
4. Add **storage**: 8–30 GB is typical
5. Configure **security group**:

   * Acts as a firewall
   * For Linux SSH, allow **port 22** from your IP only
   * For web servers, you may allow **port 80/443**

### 🔍 What happens here:

* AWS reserves IP and networking resources for your instance
* Security group defines which traffic can reach your instance
* EBS volume is your virtual hard drive attached to the instance

---

## 🔑 6. Step 4 — Review & Launch

1. Review your configuration:

   * Instance type: t2.micro
   * AMI: Amazon Linux 2
   * Key pair: your selected SSH key
   * Security group rules: only required ports open

2. Click **Launch Instance**.

### 🔍 What happens:

* AWS allocates the virtual machine
* Bootstraps OS from AMI
* Assigns IP & networking configuration
* Attaches storage volume

## 🖥️ 7. Step 5 — Connect to your EC2 instance

### a) Get instance details:

1. Go to **Instances** → click your instance → note **Public IPv4** or **Public DNS**
2. Ensure **status checks** show **2/2 checks passed** (instance ready)

### b) Connect via SSH (Linux/Mac/Windows WSL):

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>
```

* `-i` → your private key
* `ec2-user` → default username for Amazon Linux
* `<Public-IP>` → your instance’s public IP

> On Windows, you can also use **PuTTY** (convert `.pem` to `.ppk`).

### 🔍 What happens here:

* SSH authenticates using your private key
* Connects securely over the internet
* You get a terminal on your EC2 instance

---

## 🛠️ 8. Step 6 — Basic EC2 setup

Once connected, you can:

* Update packages:

```bash
sudo yum update -y   # Amazon Linux
```

* Install web server:

```bash
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

* Access web server via browser: `http://<Public-IP>`

### 🔍 What happens here:

* EC2 instance acts as a real Linux server
* System packages updated to latest security patches
* Web server installed and running automatically on boot

---

## 🔒 9. Step 7 — Security & cleanup

* Keep **SSH key private**
* Only open necessary ports in **security group**
* Stop or terminate instances when not needed to avoid unexpected charges:

```bash
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
```

* Monitor **CloudWatch** for CPU/network usage if needed
