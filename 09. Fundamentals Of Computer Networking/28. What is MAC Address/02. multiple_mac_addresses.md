A computer or mobile device doesn’t have just **one MAC address**. Instead, each **network interface** (physical or virtual) has its **own unique MAC address**. This is because the MAC address is tied to the **Network Interface Controller (NIC)**, and a single system can have multiple NICs for different connection types.

## 1. **Ethernet (Wired LAN) MAC Address** 🖧

* Every Ethernet card or built-in LAN port has its own MAC address.
* Example: Desktop PCs often have one or two Ethernet ports, each with a separate MAC.
* If you plug in a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, that adapter also comes with its own MAC.

## 2. **Wi-Fi (Wireless LAN) MAC Address** 📶

* Your Wi-Fi adapter has a different MAC from your Ethernet adapter.
* Laptops, smartphones, and tablets use this when connecting to wireless networks.
* Many modern devices support **MAC randomization** for privacy (different MACs per Wi-Fi network).

## 3. **Bluetooth MAC Address** 🎧

* Bluetooth radios also have MAC addresses, used to uniquely identify your device when pairing (e.g., with headphones, speakers, or keyboards).
* Usually, this address is different from Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

## 4. **USB Network Adapters / Dongles** 🔌

* Any external USB NIC (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G/5G modem) comes with its own MAC.
* These are often factory-assigned by the device manufacturer.

## 5. **Virtual Network Interfaces (VMs & VPNs)** 🖥️

* Virtual machines (VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, etc.) generate virtual MAC addresses for each virtual NIC.
* VPN clients may also use **virtual adapters**, each with a MAC.
* Cloud/virtual environments let you manually assign MACs to virtual NICs.

### 📌 Example (Laptop Scenario):

A single laptop could easily have:

* **Ethernet port** → `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
* **Wi-Fi adapter** → `20:4F:AA:BC:12:34`
* **Bluetooth** → `A0:B1:C2:D3:E4:F5`
* **USB-to-Ethernet dongle** → `C8:92:5E:11:22:33`
* **VirtualBox VM NIC** → `08:00:27:12:34:56`

Each one is unique and works independently within its network domain.

👉 So, when you run a command like `ipconfig /all` (Windows) or `ip link show` (Linux), you’ll see **multiple MAC addresses** listed — one for each active interface.
