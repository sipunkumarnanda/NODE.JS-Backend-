Port numbers are **unique numerical identifiers** assigned to specific processes or services on a computer network.
They help in **distinguishing different types of traffic** (like web, email, FTP) over the same network connection.

# 🧩 Why Do We Need Port Numbers?

* 🌐 A single computer can run multiple services (e.g., web server, email, file sharing).
* 🔀 Port numbers help route the incoming/outgoing data to the **correct service**.
* 🎯 Without port numbers, the computer wouldn’t know whether the data is for the **browser**, **mail client**, or another program.

# ⚙️ Structure of Port Numbers

* Port numbers are **16-bit unsigned integers**.
* Range: **0 – 65,535**
* Divided into categories:

  1. **Well-known Ports (0–1023)** – Standard services (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).
  2. **Registered Ports (1024–49,151)** – Assigned to specific applications.
  3. **Dynamic/Private Ports (49,152–65,535)** – Temporary ports used by client devices.
