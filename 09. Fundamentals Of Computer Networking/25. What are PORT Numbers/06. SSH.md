**SSH** stands for **Secure Shell**. It is a **network protocol** that allows you to **securely access and manage a remote computer** over an unsecured network.

Think of it like a **locked tunnel** 🔒 between your computer and the remote server, keeping your data safe while you work remotely.

# 🧩 Why SSH is Important

* 🔒 **Encryption:** All data (commands, files, passwords) is encrypted.
* 🖥️ **Remote Access:** You can log in and control another computer from anywhere.
* 📁 **Secure File Transfer:** Transfer files using `SCP` or `SFTP` without risking interception.
* 🛡️ **Security:** Prevents eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access.

# ⚙️ How SSH Works

1. **Client and Server:**

   * **SSH Client**: Your computer.
   * **SSH Server**: The remote machine you want to access.

2. **Authentication:**

   * Usually via **username & password** or **public/private key pairs** 🔑.

3. **Encrypted Connection:**

   * SSH encrypts all data sent between client and server.
   * Ensures that even if someone intercepts packets, they cannot read them.

4. **Command Execution / File Transfer:**

   * After login, you can run commands remotely or transfer files securely.

# 🌐 Common SSH Usage

| Command                             | Purpose                                |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `ssh user@hostname`                 | Connect to a remote server             |
| `scp file.txt user@hostname:/path/` | Securely copy files to a remote server |
| `sftp user@hostname`                | Open a secure file transfer session    |

# 🔢 Default Port

* **SSH uses port 22** 🚪 (a well-known port) for secure connections.

---

# ✅ Key Takeaways

* SSH is **secure remote login** + **encrypted communication**.
* Uses **port 22** by default.
* Supports **command execution**, **file transfer**, and **tunnel creation**.
* Safer than older protocols like Telnet because **all traffic is encrypted**.
