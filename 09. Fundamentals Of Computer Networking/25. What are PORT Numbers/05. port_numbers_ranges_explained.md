Port numbers are **16-bit unsigned integers** → maximum = **2¹⁶ = 65,536**.
They are used to identify **specific applications or services** on a machine.

Think of:

* **IP Address 🏠** → The building’s street address.
* **Port Number 🚪** → The apartment/room number in the building.

Together, they make sure data reaches the **right machine** and the **right process**.

# 📊 Port Number Ranges

| Range               | Category                     | Purpose                                                                                    | Notes                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0 – 1023**        | 🔹 Well-Known Ports          | Used by **standard services and protocols** (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS).                   | Reserved for OS and system services. Requires admin/root privileges to bind. |
| **1024 – 49,151**   | 🔸 Registered Ports          | Used by **software vendors and applications** (e.g., databases, middleware, game servers). | Assigned by IANA to specific applications.                                   |
| **49,152 – 65,535** | 🔹 Dynamic / Ephemeral Ports | Used **temporarily by client applications** when connecting to servers.                    | Chosen automatically by OS for outbound connections.                         |

# 🔑 Why This Division?

* **Well-Known Ports (0–1023)** 🛠️

  * These are “universal standards.”
  * Example:

    * Port 80 = HTTP 🌐
    * Port 22 = SSH 🔒
    * Port 53 = DNS 🌍
  * Only **system-level services** usually use these.

* **Registered Ports (1024–49,151)** 🗂️

  * Assigned by IANA to popular applications.
  * Examples:

    * 3306 = MySQL 🗄️
    * 3389 = RDP 🖥️
    * 5432 = PostgreSQL 🗂️

* **Dynamic/Ephemeral Ports (49,152–65,535)** 🔄

  * Used for **temporary communication**.
  * Example: When your browser connects to `google.com:443`, your PC uses a random source port like **52,110**.
  * The OS automatically picks an ephemeral port for each new outgoing request.

# 📦 How Ports Work in a Request

When a client talks to a server:

* **Source IP** = Client machine 🖥️
* **Source Port** = Ephemeral (from 49,152–65,535) 🔄
* **Destination IP** = Server machine 🌍
* **Destination Port** = Well-known/registered service (like 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

👉 The OS uses this combination `(src IP, src port, dst IP, dst port)` to deliver data to the **right service**.

# 📖 Example Flow

1. You open `https://google.com`.
2. Browser chooses **source port = 52,210** (ephemeral).
3. Destination = `google.com:443` (HTTPS).
4. Connection is:

```
Client: 192.168.1.5:52210  --->  Server: 142.250.190.14:443
```

5. Google’s server replies back to the **same source port (52210)**.

This ensures your data returns to your specific browser session 🔄.

# ✅ Key Takeaways

* 🔹 **0–1023 → Well-Known Ports** → Standard protocols (HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.).
* 🔸 **1024–49,151 → Registered Ports** → Assigned to vendor apps (databases, services).
* 🔹 **49,152–65,535 → Ephemeral Ports** → Temporary ports for clients.
* 🚪 Ports ensure **multiple applications** can run on one machine without conflict.
* 🌍 Each connection is identified by **Source IP + Source Port + Destination IP + Destination Port**.
