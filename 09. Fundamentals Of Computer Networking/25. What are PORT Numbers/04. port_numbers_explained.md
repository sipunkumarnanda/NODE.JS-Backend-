A **Port Number** is a unique 16-bit number that helps identify specific processes or services on a networked device.

Think of an **IP address** as the **street address of a building** 🏠, and port numbers as the **apartment door numbers** 🚪 inside that building.
They allow multiple applications to use the same IP address without confusion.

# 🧩 Why Do We Need Port Numbers?

* 🌐 A computer runs many services (web server, email, file transfer, etc.).
* 🔀 Port numbers help direct **incoming/outgoing traffic** to the correct application.
* 🎯 Without them, the OS wouldn’t know whether the data is meant for a **browser**, **email app**, or **chat client**.

# 🔢 Structure of Port Numbers

* Port numbers are **16-bit unsigned integers**.
* Range: **0 to 65,535 (2¹⁶ total)**.

👉 Categories of port numbers:

1. **Well-Known Ports (0–1023)** – Standardized, used by system services.
2. **Registered Ports (1024–49,151)** – Assigned to user or vendor applications.
3. **Dynamic/Private/Ephemeral Ports (49,152–65,535)** – Used temporarily by client devices.

# 🧭 Key Points to Remember

* Each **connection** is uniquely identified by:
  **(Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port)**
* Ports let **many services** run on a single machine without conflict.
* **Well-known ports** are standardized, while **registered/dynamic ports** are more flexible.
* Total possible ports: **65,536** (0–65,535).
