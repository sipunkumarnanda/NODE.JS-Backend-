Computers communicate with each other using **networks**. A network allows two or more devices to **send and receive data** (messages, files, videos, etc.) through wired or wireless connections.

# 1️⃣ The Basics of Communication

* 🌐 **Network** – A collection of devices (computers, servers, smartphones) connected together.
* 📡 **Medium** – The path data travels (Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, optical fiber).
* 📩 **Protocol** – A set of rules that define how communication happens (like languages humans use).

Example: Just like humans need a **common language** to talk, computers need **protocols** to communicate.

# 2️⃣ The Process of Communication

### 🔄 Step 1: Data Creation

* A user wants to send a message, email, or file.
* This information is converted into **digital data (0s and 1s)**.

### 📦 Step 2: Data Packaging (Encapsulation)

* Data is split into **small packets**.
* Each packet contains:

  * **Source address** (sender’s IP)
  * **Destination address** (receiver’s IP)
  * **Port number** (service identifier)
  * **Actual data**

### 🚀 Step 3: Transmission

* Packets are sent through the network medium (Wi-Fi, LAN cable, etc.).
* Devices like **routers, switches, and modems** guide the packets along the best path.

### 📥 Step 4: Reception

* The receiver’s computer collects all packets.
* Packets are reassembled into the original message/file.

### ✅ Step 5: Acknowledgement

* The receiver sends a **response** back (like “message received”).

# 3️⃣ Protocols That Make Communication Possible

* **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)** 🌍

  * The main communication framework of the Internet.
* **HTTP/HTTPS** 🌐 – For browsing websites.
* **SMTP/IMAP/POP3** 📧 – For email.
* **FTP** 📂 – For file transfer.
* **DNS** 📖 – Translates domain names into IP addresses.

# 4️⃣ IP Addresses & Port Numbers

* **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** 🏠

  * Like a computer’s “home address” on the network.
  * Identifies **which device** to send data to.

* **Port Numbers** 🚪

  * Like doors of a house, each port represents a specific service (e.g., 80 = HTTP).
  * Helps deliver data to the **correct application**.

# 5️⃣ Types of Communication

* **Unicast** 🎯 – One computer talks directly to another (one-to-one).
* **Broadcast** 📢 – One computer sends to **all devices** in the network.
* **Multicast** 🎥 – One computer sends to a **specific group** (e.g., live streaming).

# 6️⃣ Real-World Example 🌍

1. You open a browser and type `www.google.com`.
2. DNS converts the name into an IP address (like 142.250.190.14).
3. Your computer sends a request packet to Google’s server via **HTTP/HTTPS**.
4. Google’s server responds with data (webpage contents).
5. Your browser reassembles packets into the website you see.

# 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Computers talk via **networks, IP addresses, and protocols** 📡.
* Data is **broken into packets** for transmission.
* **Routers and switches** guide data to the correct path.
* **Protocols ensure order and reliability** of communication.
