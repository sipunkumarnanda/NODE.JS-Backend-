
## 🌍 **1. The Core of the Internet — Global Backbone**

At the highest level, the internet is made up of a **global web of fiber-optic cables** — both **land-based and undersea** — connecting countries, continents, and data centers.

### 📡 **Who owns the core?**

* **Tier 1 ISPs** — companies that own massive infrastructure and don’t pay anyone for global access.

  * Examples: **AT\&T, Level 3 (Lumen), Tata Communications, NTT, GTT, Cogent**

### 🌐 **How it works**

* They maintain high-speed **backbone routers** in major cities and **undersea cable landing stations**.
* These links carry **terabits per second** of data globally.
* Tier 1 ISPs **peer** with each other (no payment) using **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**.

## 🌊 **2. Undersea Cables – The Internet's Global Bridges**

* Huge **fiber-optic cables** run beneath the oceans, connecting continents.
* Each cable has multiple fibers and can carry **dozens of terabits per second**.
* Data travels as light pulses through these cables — incredibly fast (almost speed of light).

🧠 Example:

* You open **YouTube in India**, and the video might be coming from a **data center in the U.S.**, passing through:

  * A **Tier 1 ISP in the US**
  * Across an **undersea cable**
  * Into a **Tier 1 or Tier 2 ISP in India**

## 🧭 **3. Tier 2 ISPs – Regional Transit Providers**

* These ISPs don’t own full global infrastructure but **buy bandwidth from Tier 1 ISPs** and **sell it to Tier 3 or businesses**.
* Examples:

  * **Airtel (India)**, **Vodafone**, **Comcast (USA)**

### What they do:

* Manage national and regional **IP routing**
* Operate **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)** where networks meet and peer
* Often host **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** like Cloudflare, Google, Akamai

## 🏘️ **4. Tier 3 ISPs – Local Providers / Last Mile**

* These are **local ISPs** — like the one you might be building!
* They **buy bandwidth** from Tier 2 providers and **serve end-users**:

  * Homes
  * Small businesses
  * Apartments

### What they handle:

* **Last mile connectivity** (fiber, DSL, wireless, coaxial, etc.)
* **PPPoE servers**, **DHCP**, **NAT**, **CGNAT**
* Often use **MikroTik, Cisco, Juniper** to manage user sessions and IP addressing

## 🏠 **5. Your Home Setup – End User**

| Device           | Role                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ONT or Modem** | Converts fiber/cable signal to Ethernet                  |
| **Router**       | Handles **NAT**, **DHCP**, **firewall**, and often Wi-Fi |
| **Wi-Fi**        | Provides access to your phones, laptops, TVs             |
| **LAN**          | Local network of your home devices                       |

## 🔄 **Full Path Example (YouTube Video)**

Let’s say you watch a video on YouTube from your home in **Mumbai**:

1. **YouTube Server (USA)** → Data leaves a data center
2. **Tier 1 ISP (Lumen)** → Sends traffic across the internet
3. **Undersea Cable (e.g., SEA-ME-WE-5)** → Travels across the ocean
4. **Tier 1 or Tier 2 ISP in India (e.g., Tata Communications)**
5. **Your ISP (Tier 3)** → Your fiber/cable provider
6. **Your Router** → Handles NAT, firewall, etc.
7. **Your Phone or Laptop** → Plays the video!

## 🔚 Summary – The Journey of the Internet

> The internet is not just "the cloud" — it’s a massive **physical and logical infrastructure** made of cables, routers, and agreements. From **data centers**, across **undersea cables**, through **tiered ISPs**, the signal finally reaches your **home router**, and then your device.
