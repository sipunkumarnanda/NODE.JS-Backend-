
# 🌐 The Story of the World Wide Web (WWW) – Full Timeline & Explanation

---

## 🧠 What Is the World Wide Web?

> The **World Wide Web (WWW)** is a system of interlinked **hypertext documents** accessed through the **internet** using a **web browser**. It uses technologies like **HTML, HTTP, and URLs** to allow users to browse information online.

## 🧭 Timeline: How the Web Was Born and Evolved

---

### 📅 **1989: The Idea Was Born (CERN, Switzerland)**

* Scientists at **CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research)** in Switzerland used the **internet** mainly for **file transfers** and emails.
* There was **no web** yet — just basic networking (like FTP and Telnet).
* Scientists needed a better way to **share research papers**, data, and link related documents together.

### 👨‍🔬 Enter: **Tim Berners-Lee**

* A British scientist working at CERN.
* Observed the inefficiency of disconnected documents and proposed a system to **link documents** together.
* Wanted users to **click on a link** and be taken to another document/page — what we now call **hyperlinking**.

### 🧱 What Did Tim Invent?

| Technology               | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML**                 | *HyperText Markup Language* — used to create web pages                                  |
| **HTTP**                 | *HyperText Transfer Protocol* — the communication protocol between browsers and servers |
| **URL**                  | *Uniform Resource Locator* — used to locate pages on the web                            |
| **WorldWideWeb Browser** | First web browser AND editor (later renamed Nexus)                                      |
| **First Web Server**     | A program to serve HTML files using HTTP (built into his own computer)                  |

All of these were created by **Tim Berners-Lee** between **1989–1990**.

### 🖥️ 1990: The First Browser – *WorldWideWeb*

* Written by Tim himself on a NeXT computer.
* It could:

  * Read HTML pages
  * Follow hyperlinks
  * Edit and publish HTML documents

It was a **WYSIWYG editor + browser** — a revolutionary idea.

---

### 🌍 1991: The Web Goes Public

* CERN released the **first website**: [http://info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch)
* The site explained how to use the Web, HTTP, and create your own websites.
* For the first two years (1989–1991), it was **internal to CERN**.
* In **1991**, it was **opened to the public**, allowing anyone to browse and build websites.

---

### 🌐 1993: The Mosaic Browser Arrives

* Developed by **Marc Andreessen** and **Eric Bina** at the **NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications)**.
* First **graphical browser** — supported images, fonts, and user-friendly UI.
* Helped the Web explode in popularity.
* Mosaic led to the creation of **Netscape Navigator**, the dominant browser of the 1990s.

---

### 🧱 1995: The Web Becomes Interactive (JavaScript)

* Netscape introduced **JavaScript** in 1995 to make web pages interactive (e.g., form validation, animations).
* Before this, all websites were **static HTML**.

---

### 🎨 1996: CSS Brings Styling

* **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** introduced to separate **design** from **structure**.
* Allowed developers to control fonts, colors, spacing, layout, etc.
* Made websites visually appealing and consistent.

---

### 💣 1995–2000: The Dot-Com Boom

* Rapid growth of **internet companies (dot-coms)**.
* Everyone wanted a website.
* Venture capital flooded into internet startups.
* **Netscape**, **Yahoo**, **Amazon**, **eBay**, and **Google** emerged during this time.

---

## 🌐 All Web Browsers Use HTTP

* **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of data communication on the web.
* It sits on top of **TCP/IP**.
* Every browser — from Mosaic to Chrome — uses HTTP (or HTTPS) to communicate with servers.

Initially, only the **GET** method was supported in HTTP. Later versions added:

* `POST` – for sending data (forms)
* `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, etc.

## 🌍 Final Thoughts

> The **World Wide Web** revolutionized how humans share information. From scientific documents at CERN to full-scale apps like YouTube and Facebook — it all started with the simple idea of **clickable links** and **interconnected documents**. The web has since evolved into the most powerful communication medium in human history.
