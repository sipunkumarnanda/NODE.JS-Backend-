Great question ‚Äî this is a very common point of confusion. Below I‚Äôll explain **why identical private IPs happen**, what **private vs public IPs** are, the role of **NAT/routers**, and **every practical way** you can actually connect to your friend‚Äôs SSH server from your house (with commands, router steps, alternatives, security notes, and troubleshooting). Deep, practical, and step-by-step. üîéüîê

---

# üåê Short answer (one line)

The `192.168.0.105` you and your friend each see are **private (local) IPs on your separate home networks**. They‚Äôre not directly reachable from the internet. To connect across the internet you must use the friend‚Äôs **public IP** (or a relay/VPN/tunnel), and usually configure the friend‚Äôs router to forward incoming SSH traffic to his private `192.168.0.105` machine ‚Äî or use NAT-traversal tools (Tailscale, ngrok, reverse SSH, etc.).

---

# üß≠ Key concepts ‚Äî understand the network model

### 1. Private IP vs Public IP

* **Private IP** (e.g. `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x`)

  * Assigned inside a local network (your router).
  * Not routable on the internet. Many different networks all use the same private ranges ‚Äî that's why both you and your friend can have `192.168.0.105`.
* **Public IP**

  * The single IP your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns to your home router. This is what the rest of the internet sees.

You can see your public IP on the machine by running:

```bash
curl -s ifconfig.me
# or
curl -s icanhazip.com
```

### 2. NAT (Network Address Translation)

* Your router performs **NAT**: it rewrites outbound traffic from your private IPs to the router‚Äôs public IP and keeps track of the connection so replies come back to the right internal device.
* NAT **blocks unsolicited inbound** connections by default ‚Äî that‚Äôs why an outside machine cannot directly address `192.168.0.105` behind someone else's router.

### 3. Why identical private IPs are fine

* Private ranges are reused worldwide by each local network. They are *only* meaningful **inside** that network. Two hosts on different networks can have the same private IP without conflict.

# üõ†Ô∏è Real ways to connect to your friend‚Äôs SSH server (ranked by practicality)

Below are practical methods, with commands and detailed steps.

---

## Option A ‚Äî Port forwarding on friend‚Äôs router (classic method) üîå

**How it works:** configure the friend‚Äôs router to forward a chosen public port (e.g. `2222`) to the friend‚Äôs internal machine `192.168.0.105:22`.

**Steps (friend performs):**

1. **Find the friend‚Äôs public IP** (on their machine or router):

   ```bash
   curl -s ifconfig.me
   ```
2. **Give the server machine a static local IP** (so it doesn‚Äôt change) ‚Äî either set a DHCP reservation in the router for the MAC address or configure static IP on the server (e.g., `192.168.0.105`).
3. **Add port forwarding rule** on the router‚Äôs admin page:

   * External Port: `2222` (or `22` if you prefer)
   * Protocol: `TCP`
   * Internal IP: `192.168.0.105`
   * Internal Port: `22`
4. **Ensure firewall on friend‚Äôs machine allows incoming** on port 22 (or the internal port).

   * Ubuntu example:

     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
     # or if forwarding to 2222 locally:
     sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
     ```
5. **(Optional) Set dynamic DNS** if public IP is dynamic (see below).

**From your side (client):**

```bash
ssh -p 2222 username@FRIEND_PUBLIC_IP
# e.g.
ssh -p 2222 sipun@203.0.113.42
```

**Notes & pitfalls:**

* If router/ISP uses **Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)**, port forwarding is impossible because the router doesn‚Äôt have a unique public IPv4. In that case, use other options below.
* If ISP blocks inbound port 22, use a high-numbered port (e.g. 2222) or check with ISP.
* Security: forward a nonstandard port, strongly prefer key-based auth, and restrict source IPs if router supports it.

---

## Option B ‚Äî Dynamic DNS (DynDNS) ‚Äî keeps track of changing public IPs üîÅ

If the friend‚Äôs public IP changes periodically, use a Dynamic DNS service (DuckDNS, No-IP, etc.) to give a hostname (e.g. `friend.example.duckdns.org`) that always resolves to the current public IP. Then combine with port forwarding.

**Basic flow:**

* Friend runs a dynamic-update client or router supports DDNS.
* You connect: `ssh -p 2222 user@friendhost.duckdns.org`

---

## Option C ‚Äî Use a VPN or mesh network (recommended for convenience & security) üõ°Ô∏è

**Examples:** Tailscale, ZeroTier, WireGuard. These create a virtual network where both machines obtain routable addresses on the same overlay network ‚Äî no router port-forwarding required.

**Why use it:**

* Works even if ISP uses CGNAT.
* Easier and more secure than opening ports.
* Tailscale uses WireGuard and gives each device a stable, private address you can SSH to.

**General steps (Tailscale example):**

1. Both you and your friend install Tailscale and login to the same Tailscale account or organization.
2. Each machine gets a Tailscale IP like `100.x.y.z`.
3. From your machine:

   ```bash
   ssh user@100.x.y.z
   ```

**Advantages:** NAT traversal handled for you; encrypted; no port forwarding.

---

## Option D ‚Äî Reverse SSH tunnel (friend initiates a connection to you) ‚ôªÔ∏è

Useful if your machine has a public IP or a reachable server (a VPS). The friend creates a persistent SSH connection to your server and opens a remote port that forwards back to their local SSH.

**Flow:** friend ‚Üí your public server (or your PC with public IP) ‚Üí you connect to that server to reach friend.

**Example (friend runs):**

```bash
# On friend's machine (creates remote forward from remote-server:2222 to local:22)
ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 youruser@YOUR_PUBLIC_SERVER
# Add -N -f for background: ssh -f -N -R 2222:localhost:22 youruser@PUBLIC_IP
```

**Then you (from anywhere) connect to the public server and SSH to forwarded port:**

```bash
ssh -p 2222 frienduser@localhost   # when already on the public server
# or from your local machine:
ssh -p 2222 youruser@YOUR_PUBLIC_SERVER -t "ssh frienduser@localhost"
# or with direct address:
ssh -J youruser@YOUR_PUBLIC_SERVER frienduser@localhost -p 2222
```

**Notes:** Keep tunnel alive with `autossh` or systemd service. Use keys and restrict the reverse tunnel to specific ports; beware security.

---

## Option E ‚Äî Use a cloud/bastion server (VPS) as relay üõ∞Ô∏è

Spin up a small VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, etc.). Both you and your friend SSH into the VPS; friend opens a reverse tunnel from the VPS ‚Äî same idea as Option D but using a secure cloud host.

---

## Option F ‚Äî P2P hole punching / STUN/TURN ‚Äî used by apps (hard for raw SSH) üîß

Techniques to punch through symmetric NAT exist (STUN/TURN/ICE) but are complicated to implement with raw SSH. Usually used by P2P apps (WebRTC). Not recommended unless you use a tool that implements it.

---

## Option G ‚Äî Using tunneling services (easy single-command) üå©Ô∏è

Services such as **ngrok**, **Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared)**, or similar can expose a local port to the internet via a secure tunnel.

**ngrok example:**

* Friend runs:

  ```bash
  ngrok tcp 22
  ```
* ngrok prints a public address like `0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`. You connect:

  ```bash
  ssh -p 12345 user@0.tcp.ngrok.io
  ```

**Note:** ngrok free plan may have limitations; pay-for features offer stable hostnames.

---

# üîê Security recommendations (do these before exposing SSH)

* **Use public-key authentication** (generate with `ssh-keygen` and install public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`); then set `PasswordAuthentication no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
* **Use a non-default external port** (e.g., 2222) to reduce automated scans.
* **Limit allowed users** (`AllowUsers` in `sshd_config`) or use firewall to restrict source IP ranges.
* **Monitor logs** (`/var/log/auth.log` or `journalctl -u ssh`) and consider Fail2Ban.
* **Use strong keys** (Ed25519 recommended) and protect private keys with passphrases + ssh-agent.

# ‚úÖ Practical example: Friend sets up port forwarding and you connect

**Friend side (steps):**

1. Set static local IP: `192.168.0.105`.
2. In router admin ‚Üí Port Forwarding:

   * External Port: `2222`
   * Internal Port: `22`
   * Internal IP: `192.168.0.105`
   * Protocol: TCP
3. Ensure server listens on 22: `sudo ss -tlnp | grep sshd`
4. Ensure firewall allows 22: `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp` (or adjust accordingly).
5. Find public IP: `curl -s ifconfig.me` ‚Üí suppose `203.0.113.42`.

**You connect:**

```bash
ssh -p 2222 sipun@203.0.113.42
```

---

# üß™ Troubleshooting checklist if connection fails

* Does `curl -s ifconfig.me` on friend show the same IP as the router‚Äôs WAN IP page? If not, ISP may be using CGNAT (no port forwarding).
* Can friend access the server from outside their LAN? (Test from a mobile network or ask someone else to try).
* Is the router forwarding to the correct internal IP and port? (Double-check DHCP reservation).
* Is the friend‚Äôs local firewall allowing SSH? (`sudo ufw status`).
* Is the server `sshd` running and listening? (`sudo systemctl status ssh` and `ss -tlnp | grep :22`).
* Use `nmap` or `telnet` from your side to test connectivity to the public IP and port:

  ```bash
  nc -vz 203.0.113.42 2222     # netcat verbose test
  # or
  telnet 203.0.113.42 2222
  ```
* If connection times out ‚Üí likely firewall / router / ISP blocking. If `Connection refused` ‚Üí sshd not listening on that port.

---

# üìå Special case: ISP uses CGNAT ‚Äî what to do?

If friend‚Äôs ISP places them behind Carrier-Grade NAT (no unique public IPv4), port forwarding won‚Äôt work. Use one of:

* Tailscale/ZeroTier (works through CGNAT),
* Reverse SSH to a VPS you both can reach,
* Cloudflare Tunnel / ngrok,
* Ask ISP for a public IP or a static IP (sometimes paid).

---

# üßæ Quick decision guide (which option to choose)

* **If friend can edit router and has a public IP** ‚Üí use **port forwarding + dynamic DNS** (Option A + B).
* **If either side is behind CGNAT or router access is hard** ‚Üí use **Tailscale/ZeroTier** (mesh VPN) or **ngrok/cloudflared** (tunneling).
* **If you have a VPS** ‚Üí use **Reverse SSH** or a **bastion host**.
* **If you need temporary quick access** ‚Üí run `ngrok tcp 22` on friend and connect to provided host:port.

# üßæ Useful commands summary

Find public IP:

```bash
curl -s ifconfig.me
```

Check SSH server:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :22
```

Test TCP connectivity from client:

```bash
nc -vz FRIEND_PUBLIC_IP 2222
```

SSH connect:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 user@FRIEND_PUBLIC_IP
# or using a key file
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 user@FRIEND_PUBLIC_IP
```

Reverse SSH tunnel (friend to your server):

```bash
ssh -f -N -R 2222:localhost:22 youruser@YOUR_PUBLIC_SERVER
# Then you:
ssh -p 2222 frienduser@YOUR_PUBLIC_SERVER
```

---

# ‚úÖ Final checklist before trying to connect

1. Does friend have a reachable **public IP**? (`curl -s ifconfig.me`)
2. Is port forwarding configured (if using it)? Router -> internal IP:22.
3. Is `sshd` running on friend and listening on `:22`? (`sudo systemctl status ssh`)
4. Are firewalls (router + OS) allowing the port? (`sudo ufw status`)
5. Prefer keys over passwords; test locally first: `ssh user@localhost` on friend machine.
6. If anything blocks you, try **Tailscale** or **ngrok** ‚Äî both work around NAT.
