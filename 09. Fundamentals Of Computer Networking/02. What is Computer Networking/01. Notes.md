### 📚 In Tech Terms:

* Networking refers to:

  * Designing and managing **networks**
  * Understanding how **data travels** (packets, protocols)
  * Using **IP addresses**, **ports**, and **protocols** (HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.)
  * Ensuring **secure** and **efficient** communication between systems

### 🔧 Example in Real Life:

* When you **open a website**, your device:

  * Sends a request over a **network**
  * Reaches a remote **server**
  * Receives data (like HTML, images) to show in your browser

All of that is possible **because of networking**.
