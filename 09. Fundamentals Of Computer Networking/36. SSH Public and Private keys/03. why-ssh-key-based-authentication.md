Even though SSH supports password login, using **keys is strongly recommended** for security, convenience, and scalability. Here’s why:

---

## 1️⃣ Security Advantages 🔐

**Password login risks:**

* Passwords can be **guessed**, **brute-forced**, or **stolen**.
* Users often reuse weak passwords.
* Passwords are vulnerable if transmitted or stored improperly.

**Key-based advantages:**

* Authentication uses a **cryptographic key pair** — virtually impossible to brute-force if the key is strong (ED25519 or RSA 4096-bit).
* The private key **never leaves your machine**, so even if the network is compromised, attackers cannot intercept it.
* Optionally, keys can have **passphrases** for an extra layer of protection.

> 🔹 Bottom line: Keys eliminate the weakest link — human-chosen passwords.

## 2️⃣ Automation & Convenience 🤖

* Key-based authentication allows **password-less login**, which is essential for:

  * Automated scripts
  * Cron jobs
  * CI/CD pipelines
  * Backup processes

* Password-based login requires manual typing, making automation either impossible or insecure (storing passwords in scripts).

> 🔹 Bottom line: Keys make automation safe and scalable.

## 3️⃣ Scalability & Management 🏗️

* With many servers, managing passwords becomes cumbersome.

* SSH keys can be centrally deployed and revoked easily:

  * Add or remove public keys from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
  * Limit access per key using `from=`, `command=`, or `no-pty` options.

* Password changes require coordination across all systems; keys simplify access control.

## 4️⃣ Protection Against Attacks 🛡️

**Key-based authentication protects against:**

* Brute-force attacks
* Password guessing
* Credential theft over compromised networks

**Password login is vulnerable to:**

* Dictionary attacks
* Credential leaks
* Social engineering

> 🔹 Bottom line: Key-based login drastically reduces attack surface.

## 5️⃣ Optional Extra Security Layers 🔒

* Keys can be combined with **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for even higher security.
* You can enforce **per-key restrictions** in `authorized_keys`, e.g., allowing a key to run only specific commands.

## ✅ Summary

| Aspect                  | Password Login               | Key-Based Login                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Security                | Medium (password vulnerable) | High (private key + optional passphrase) |
| Automation              | Hard / unsafe                | Easy / secure                            |
| Scalability             | Poor (many passwords)        | Excellent (manage keys)                  |
| Brute-Force Risk        | High                         | Minimal                                  |
| Additional Restrictions | Limited                      | Flexible per key                         |

> **Conclusion:**
> Even if users *can* log in with passwords, **SSH keys provide stronger security, automation, and control**, making them the preferred method for modern systems.
