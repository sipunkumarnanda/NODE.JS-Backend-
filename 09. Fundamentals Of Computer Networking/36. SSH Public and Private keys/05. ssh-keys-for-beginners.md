## 🌟 What Are SSH Keys?

SSH keys are like a **special digital lock and key** for logging into servers.

* **Private key 🔒** → You keep it secret on your computer
* **Public key 🔓** → You give it to the server so it can recognize you

Using keys is safer and easier than typing passwords every time.

## 🛠️ How to Generate an SSH Key

On your **computer**, run:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

* Press **Enter** to accept default locations.
* You can add a passphrase if you want extra security, or just press **Enter** to skip.

This creates two files:

* `id_rsa` → your **private key** 🔒
* `id_rsa.pub` → your **public key** 🔓

## 📤 Adding Your Public Key to the Server

On the **server**:

1. Check if `.ssh` folder exists:

```bash
ls -la ~/
```

2. If not, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
```

3. Go into the folder:

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
```

4. Create or open `authorized_keys`:

```bash
nano authorized_keys
```

5. Paste your **public key** (`id_rsa.pub`) into this file.

6. Save and exit:

* Press `Ctrl + X` → `Y` → `Enter`

> ✅ Now the server knows your key and will let you log in.

## 🚀 Logging in Using Your SSH Key

Back on your **computer**, connect to the server:

```bash
ssh user@server
```

* If everything is set up, you won’t need a password.
* If you set a passphrase, it will ask for that once.

* Generate them with `ssh-keygen`
* Put your **public key** on the server (`authorized_keys`)
* Keep your **private key** secret 🔒
* Connect with `ssh user@server`
