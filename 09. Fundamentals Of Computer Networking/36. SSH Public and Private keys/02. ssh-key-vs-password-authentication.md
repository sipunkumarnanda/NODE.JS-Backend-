SSH (Secure Shell) can authenticate users in two main ways:

1. Using **keys** (cryptographic authentication)
2. Using **passwords** (traditional login)

Let’s dive deep into both — how they work, how they differ, and which is better 👇

---

## 🔑 1. SSH Key-Based Authentication

### 💡 What It Is

SSH key-based authentication uses a **pair of cryptographic keys** — one **public** and one **private** — to verify your identity **without using a password**.

It’s considered the **most secure and automated** method for SSH access.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works — Step-by-Step

1. 🧩 **Generate a key pair** on your local machine:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
   ```

   This creates:

   * 🔒 Private key → `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
   * 🔓 Public key → `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

2. 📤 **Copy the public key** to the remote server:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user@remotehost
   ```

   (This adds your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server.)

3. 🔐 **Connect securely** using your private key:

   ```bash
   ssh user@remotehost
   ```

   * The server sends a cryptographic challenge encrypted with your public key.
   * Your client decrypts it with your private key.
   * If it matches, access is granted — no password needed!

### 🧰 Advantages

✅ **More Secure:**

* No password transmitted over the network.
* Immune to brute-force or dictionary attacks.

✅ **Convenient:**

* Automates logins (great for scripts, CI/CD, backups).
* Works with `ssh-agent` to avoid re-entering passphrases.

✅ **Auditable & Restrictable:**

* Keys can be limited with `authorized_keys` options (`from=`, `command=`, etc.).

---

### ⚠️ Considerations

* Protect your **private key** — if leaked, anyone can impersonate you.
* Use **passphrases** for extra protection.
* Use `ssh-agent` to manage keys securely in memory.

## 🔓 2. SSH Key-Less (Password-Based) Authentication

### 💡 What It Is

This is the **default SSH authentication method** — you log in using your **username and password** directly on the server.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. You type:

   ```bash
   ssh user@server
   ```
2. The server asks for a password:

   ```
   user@server's password:
   ```
3. You enter it → if it matches the system’s user password, you get access.

---

### ⚙️ Behind the Scenes

* The password is **encrypted** in transit by SSH, so it isn’t sent in plain text.
* The server verifies it against its local user database (`/etc/shadow`, PAM, or LDAP).

---

### ⚖️ Advantages

✅ **Simple setup** — no need to manage key pairs.
✅ **Quick for one-time access** or when setting up new systems.

---

### ⚠️ Disadvantages

❌ **Less Secure:**

* Vulnerable to brute-force attacks and password guessing.
* Users often reuse weak passwords.

❌ **Not Scalable:**

* Hard to manage across many servers.
* You must type or store passwords (unsafe for automation).

❌ **No Fine-Grained Control:**

* Harder to restrict or audit compared to key-based methods.

## 🚀 Best Practice Recommendation

✅ Always prefer **SSH key-based authentication** for:

* Cloud servers
* Automation (scripts, backups, CI/CD)
* Any system exposed to the internet

🔐 Disable password logins entirely for maximum security:
In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (on server):

```
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

Then restart SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
