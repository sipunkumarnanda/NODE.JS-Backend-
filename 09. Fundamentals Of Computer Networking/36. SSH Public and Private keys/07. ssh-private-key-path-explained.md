The `-i` option tells the `ssh` client **which private key file** to use for authentication. It‚Äôs the path (location) of your private key on *your local machine* ‚Äî not the server. Below I explain how to write that path correctly with practical examples for Windows, Linux/macOS, and IPv6 addresses. üß≠‚ú®

## üß† What `-i` does (short)

When you run:

```bash
ssh -i <path-to-private-key> user@host
```

the SSH client loads the private key at `<path-to-private-key>` and uses it to respond to the server‚Äôs cryptographic challenge. The `<path-to-private-key>` must point to your **private** key (e.g., `id_ed25519`), not to the `.pub` file.

---

## ü™™ Important notes about the path

* The path is local ‚Äî the client reads the key from your computer.
* Use the private key file (e.g., `id_ed25519`, `id_rsa`), **not** the public key (`.pub`).
* If the path contains spaces, wrap it in quotes.
* On Windows you can use backslashes `\`, forward slashes `/`, or PowerShell quoting.
* For PuTTY `.ppk` keys you must either use PuTTY tools (Pageant/`plink`/`pscp`) or convert `.ppk` to OpenSSH format with `puttygen`.

## ‚úÖ Examples

### Windows ‚Äî PowerShell (modern OpenSSH client)

Paths often look like `C:\Users\alice\.ssh\id_ed25519`.

**IPv4 example**

```powershell
ssh -i "C:\Users\alice\.ssh\id_ed25519" alice@203.0.113.5
```

**IPv6 example (note square brackets around IPv6 literal when using a host:port or scp; for ssh it's optional but allowed)**

```powershell
ssh -i "C:\Users\alice\.ssh\id_ed25519" alice@[2001:db8::1]
```

**No quotes needed (no spaces in path):**

```powershell
ssh -i C:\Users\alice\.ssh\id_ed25519 alice@203.0.113.5
```

**Using forward slashes (also works):**

```powershell
ssh -i C:/Users/alice/.ssh/id_ed25519 alice@203.0.113.5
```

---

### Windows ‚Äî Command Prompt (cmd.exe)

Quotes if spaces present:

```cmd
ssh -i "C:\Users\Alice My\Keys\id_ed25519" alice@203.0.113.5
```

---

### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If key is on the WSL filesystem:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 alice@203.0.113.5
```

If key resides on the Windows C: drive:

```bash
ssh -i /mnt/c/Users/alice/.ssh/id_ed25519 alice@203.0.113.5
```

---

### Linux / macOS (typical)

Default location is `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. You can still specify it explicitly:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 alice@203.0.113.5
```

IPv6 example:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 alice@[2001:db8::1]
```

---

## üîÅ Using a non-standard SSH port

If SSH runs on a different port (e.g., `2222`), include `-p`:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 alice@203.0.113.5
# or with IPv6
ssh -i "C:\Users\alice\.ssh\id_ed25519" -p 2222 alice@[2001:db8::1]
```

---

## üîÄ PuTTY `.ppk` keys vs OpenSSH keys

* Windows `ssh` (OpenSSH) expects OpenSSH-format private keys (files like `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`).
* If you have a PuTTY `.ppk` file, either:

  * Use PuTTY tools (Pageant, PuTTY/Plink/pscp), or
  * Convert `.ppk` to OpenSSH with `puttygen`:

    ```powershell
    puttygen mykey.ppk -O private-openssh -o id_ed25519
    ```

  then use `ssh -i id_ed25519 user@host`.

---

## üìù Extra practical tips (quick)

* If you don‚Äôt want to type `-i` every time, add an entry to `~/.ssh/config`:

  ```
  Host myserver
      HostName 203.0.113.5
      User alice
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```

  Then connect with `ssh myserver`.
* Ensure you point to the **private key** file (no `.pub`).
* If your key has a passphrase, `ssh` will prompt for it; use `ssh-agent` to cache unlocked keys.

## üîç Example addressing your snippet

You wrote: `ssh -i c:\_________sipun@Ipaddress` ‚Äî the correct, safe forms would be:

**Windows PowerShell (no spaces in path):**

```powershell
ssh -i C:\Users\sipun\.ssh\id_ed25519 sipun@203.0.113.5
```

**Windows PowerShell (IPv6):**

```powershell
ssh -i "C:\Users\sipun\.ssh\id_ed25519" sipun@[2001:db8::1]
```

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
ssh -i /home/sipun/.ssh/id_ed25519 sipun@203.0.113.5
```
