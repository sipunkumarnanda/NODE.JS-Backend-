**Network topology** refers to the **physical or logical arrangement of devices and connections in a network**. It determines how devices communicate, how data flows, and impacts **scalability, performance, and fault tolerance**.

There are **six main types**:

1. Point-to-Point
2. Bus
3. Ring
4. Star (sometimes called Node/Hub-based)
5. Mesh
6. Tree
7. Hybrid

We‚Äôll cover them in depth.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Point-to-Point Topology

**Definition:** A direct connection between **two devices**.
**Example:** Two computers connected via a single cable.

**Characteristics:**

* Simplest topology.
* Communication is **dedicated**; no other devices share the connection.

**Advantages:**

* High **security** (only two devices).
* Very **fast** and low latency.
* Easy to implement for small networks.

**Disadvantages:**

* Not scalable beyond 2 devices.
* **Single link failure** disconnects communication.

**Usage:**

* Direct link between two computers.
* Modems to ISPs.

üí° Analogy: Like a **private phone line** between two people.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bus Topology (Linear)

**Definition:** All devices are connected to a **single backbone cable**.

**Characteristics:**

* Data sent from one device travels along the backbone to all others.
* Terminators are used at each end of the cable to prevent signal reflection.

**Advantages:**

* Cost-effective (less cabling).
* Easy to extend by adding more devices.

**Disadvantages:**

* Low reliability; **if backbone fails, whole network fails**.
* Performance drops as more devices are added (data collisions).

**Usage:**

* Small LANs.
* Early Ethernet networks (coaxial cables).

üí° Analogy: Like a **single road with multiple houses connected along it**.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Ring Topology

**Definition:** Devices are connected in a **circular manner**, each device connected to **two neighbors**.

**Characteristics:**

* Data flows in **one direction (unidirectional)** or sometimes bidirectional.
* Uses **token passing** to avoid collisions.

**Advantages:**

* Predictable performance; minimal collisions.
* Each device regenerates signal, maintaining signal strength.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Single device or cable failure** can disrupt the network (unless a dual ring or bypass mechanism is used).
* Adding or removing devices can disrupt the network temporarily.

**Usage:**

* Token Ring networks.
* FDDI networks.

üí° Analogy: Like **people sitting in a circle passing a message**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Star Topology (Node/Hub-based)

**Definition:** All devices connect to a **central hub, switch, or router**.

**Characteristics:**

* Central device manages all communication.
* Each device has a **dedicated cable** to the hub.

**Advantages:**

* Easy to manage and troubleshoot.
* Failure of one device does not affect the rest.
* Easy to add new devices.

**Disadvantages:**

* Central hub failure brings **entire network down**.
* More cabling required than bus.

**Usage:**

* Modern Ethernet LANs.
* Wi-Fi networks (Access Point as central hub).

üí° Analogy: Like **spokes on a bicycle wheel**, hub at the center.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Mesh Topology

**Definition:** Every device connects to **every other device directly** (full mesh) or partially (partial mesh).

**Characteristics:**

* Highly redundant; multiple paths between devices.
* Complex cabling in full mesh.

**Advantages:**

* Fault-tolerant; network still works if one link fails.
* High reliability and performance.

**Disadvantages:**

* Expensive and complex for large networks.
* Requires lots of cabling.

**Usage:**

* WAN backbone networks.
* Critical systems where uptime is essential.

üí° Analogy: Like **a web where each node connects to several others**.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Tree Topology

**Definition:** Hierarchical topology with **root node and multiple levels of branches**.

* Combines **star and bus topologies**.

**Characteristics:**

* Root acts as main hub; branches connect nodes below it.
* Often used in large networks.

**Advantages:**

* Scalable for large networks.
* Easy to manage at different hierarchical levels.

**Disadvantages:**

* Failure at higher levels (root or main branch) affects all sub-branches.
* Requires careful planning and cabling.

**Usage:**

* Corporate networks with central server and department LANs.
* File systems (logical tree).

üí° Analogy: Like a **family tree or organizational chart**.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid Topology

**Definition:** Combination of **two or more topologies** to leverage their advantages.

**Characteristics:**

* Often star-ring, star-bus, or mesh-star combinations.
* Flexible design for large, complex networks.

**Advantages:**

* Can be **optimized for cost and performance**.
* Fault-tolerant depending on combination used.

**Disadvantages:**

* Can be complex to design and maintain.
* Cabling and setup cost may be high.

**Usage:**

* Large enterprise networks.
* Campus networks connecting multiple buildings.

üí° Analogy: Like a **custom-built system** combining roads, highways, and bridges to optimize traffic.
