---

## 1️⃣ What is a GUA?

* **GUA (Global Unicast Address)** is a type of **IPv6 public address** 🌐.
* It’s **unique worldwide** and routable across the internet.
* Format range: **2000::/3** (any IPv6 address starting with `2` or `3`).

👉 Basically: **GUA = IPv6 version of a public IPv4 address.**

## 2️⃣ Identifying the GUA in Your Output

From your config:

```
IPv6 Address       : 2401:4900:3937:6650:9b5a:1fd3:8915:80e3 ✅
Temporary IPv6     : 2401:4900:3937:6650:eccd:75c7:c242:fe1a ✅
Link-local IPv6    : fe80::d98a:cee4:a467:a119%20 ❌
IPv4 Address       : 10.52.43.1 (Private, not public) ❌
```

* `2401:4900:3937:6650:9b5a:1fd3:8915:80e3` → **GUA (Global Unicast Address)** ✅
* `2401:4900:3937:6650:eccd:75c7:c242:fe1a` → **Temporary GUA** (used for privacy when browsing 🌐🔒).
* `fe80::...` → **Link-Local Address** (only valid inside local network 🚪).
* `10.52.43.1` → **Private IPv4 address** (not public ❌).

## 3️⃣ Why Do You Have a GUA?

* Your ISP assigns it to give you a **direct, unique presence on the internet**. 🌎
* No need for NAT (unlike IPv4).
* You can technically be reached from anywhere on the internet with this GUA (though firewalls usually protect you 🔐).

---

## 4️⃣ Key Difference in Your Config

* **GUA (2401:4900:...) → Public IPv6, internet-routable** 🌍
* **Temporary GUA → Protects privacy by rotating when browsing** 🕵️‍♂️
* **Link-local (fe80::...) → Only for communication within LAN** 🖧
* **IPv4 (10.x.x.x) → Private, uses NAT to reach internet** 🚧

---

✨ **In short:**

* **Your GUA is `2401:4900:3937:6650:9b5a:1fd3:8915:80e3`.**
* It’s “public” because IPv6 has enough addresses for everyone to have their own unique one 🌐.
