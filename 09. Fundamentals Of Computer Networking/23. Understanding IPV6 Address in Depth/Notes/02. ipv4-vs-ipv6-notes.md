---

## 1️⃣ Basics of IP Addressing

* **IPv4 (Internet Protocol v4)** → 32-bit addressing (≈ 4.3 billion addresses).
* **IPv6 (Internet Protocol v6)** → 128-bit addressing (≈ 340 undecillion addresses 🤯).

## 2️⃣ IPv4: Why Not Public for Everyone?

🔹 Problem: **Address Exhaustion**

* Only **4.3 billion IPv4 addresses** exist.
* Internet grew rapidly → not enough addresses for every device.
* Solution: **Private IPv4 ranges** (like 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x–172.31.x.x).
* These private addresses require **NAT (Network Address Translation)** to connect to the public internet.

👉 This makes **IPv4 not fully public** because many devices share one public IP via NAT.

## 3️⃣ IPv6: Why Mostly Public?

🔹 Solution: **Huge Address Space**

* IPv6 has **so many addresses** that every device can get its own unique **globally routable address**.
* No need for NAT in most cases 🚫.
* By default, IPv6 assigns **publicly reachable addresses** (though firewalls/security policies still apply).

👉 This makes **IPv6 “public” by design**, as almost every device can have its own direct IP on the internet.

## 4️⃣ Summary 📝

* **IPv4 → Limited, uses private ranges + NAT → Not all addresses public.**
* **IPv6 → Practically unlimited, each device can have a unique public IP → Designed for public use.**

⚡ In short:
IPv4 = 🏠 “Private houses sharing one street address” (NAT)
IPv6 = 🏙️ “Every house has its own street address” (Public by default)
