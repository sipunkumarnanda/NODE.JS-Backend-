Nice capture — let’s unpack each line from your list with clear, emoji-friendly notes.

## 1️⃣ `2401:4900:3937:6650:9b5a:1fd3:8915:80e3` — **GUA (Global Unicast Address)** ✅

* **What it is:** a globally-routable IPv6 address — the IPv6 equivalent of a public IPv4 address.
* **How you can tell:** it begins with `2` (`2401:...`), which falls into the global unicast range (commonly `2000::/3`).
* **Structure (high level):**

  * **Network/prefix** (first 64 bits typically) — provided by your ISP or router (e.g. `2401:4900:3937:6650::/64` or similar).
  * **Interface ID** (last 64 bits, here `9b5a:1fd3:8915:80e3`) — identifies the device on that subnet.
* **How it’s assigned:** either by **SLAAC** (stateless autoconfig via Router Advertisements), **DHCPv6**, or manual/static configuration.
* **Scope & routability:** reachable across the internet (unless blocked by firewalls). No NAT is required in normal IPv6 setups.
* **When used:** good for running services you want reachable (servers, some IoT), or for normal client traffic when firewall/ISP allow inbound reachability.
* **Security note:** being “public” doesn’t mean “open” — host firewalls and router rules still control access. 🔐

## 2️⃣ `2401:4900:3937:6650:eccd:75c7:c242:fe1a` — **Temporary (privacy) IPv6 address** 🔒

* **What it is:** a temporary/ephemeral IPv6 address created to **protect client privacy** when initiating outbound connections.
* **How it relates to the GUA:** it uses the **same network prefix** (`2401:4900:3937:6650:…`) but a different, **randomized interface ID** (`eccd:75c7:c242:fe1a`).
* **Why it exists:** to prevent long-term tracking of a device by source IP — browsers/OSes will prefer temporary addresses for outgoing connections so an external server can’t easily correlate visits by a stable interface ID.
* **Standards:** implemented by OS privacy extensions (RFC 4941 and related).
* **Lifetimes:** temporary addresses have limited lifetimes (preferred/valid time); the OS rotates them periodically (hours to days depending on settings).
* **Behavioral note:** the device usually keeps both a stable address (for inbound, management) and temporary addresses (for outbound). This can complicate source-based firewall rules if you rely on a fixed source IP. 🔁

## 3️⃣ `fe80::d98a:cee4:a467:a119%20` — **Link-Local IPv6 address** 🚪

* **What it is:** a link-local IPv6 address used only on the *same physical or logical link* (LAN). The `fe80::/10` block is dedicated to this.
* **Not routable:** routers do **not** forward link-local traffic — it never goes onto the internet. It’s only for communication between nodes on the same interface.
* **Common uses:** essential for IPv6 core functions: **Neighbor Discovery, Router Solicitation/Advertisement**, DHCPv6 bootstrap steps, and auto-configuration.
* **How it is formed:** often derived from the interface’s MAC (EUI-64) or generated randomly by the OS.
* **What’s `%20`?** that’s a **zone index / scope ID** (Windows style) telling the OS which interface to use (interface #20). It’s not part of the IPv6 bits sent on the wire — it’s an OS local hint to disambiguate link-local addresses on machines with multiple interfaces. 🧭

## 4️⃣ `10.52.43.1` — **IPv4 Private Address (RFC 1918)** 🚫🌐

* **What it is:** an IPv4 address from a private range. `10.0.0.0/8` is one of the three RFC-1918 private blocks (the others are `172.16.0.0/12` and `192.168.0.0/16`).
* **Not internet routable:** routers on the public internet drop RFC-1918 addresses — they are only valid inside private networks (home, office, data center).
* **Why it’s used:** IPv4 address scarcity led to widespread private addressing + **NAT** (Network Address Translation). Many devices inside a LAN share one public IPv4 address via the router’s NAT.
* **Subnet mask meaning:** you showed `255.255.255.0` → that’s `/24`, so the local network is `10.52.43.0/24` and `10.52.43.1` is a host on that LAN.
* **Default gateway:** your router/gateway likely sits at `10.52.43.206` (from your earlier output) and performs NAT to the internet. 🔁

## Quick comparison — one glance 🔍

* **GUA (IPv6)** `2401:...` → **Global**, internet-routable, usually `/64` prefix, no NAT needed. 🌍
* **Temporary GUA** `2401:... (different IID)` → **Short-lived**, randomized IID for privacy, used for outgoing connections. 🕵️‍♂️
* **Link-Local** `fe80::...%20` → **Only on the same link**, used for discovery and autoconfig, requires zone index when referenced. 🚪
* **IPv4 Private** `10.x.x.x` → **Local only**, not routable on the internet, typically behind NAT. 🔒

## Handy commands (if you want to inspect more)

* **Windows:** `ipconfig /all` (shows GUA, temporary, link-local, IPv4)
* **Linux/macOS:** `ip addr show` or `ifconfig`
* **Ping tests:** `ping <IPv4>` or `ping6 <IPv6>` (use link-local with zone: `ping6 fe80::...%eth0` or `ping6 fe80::...%20` on Windows)
