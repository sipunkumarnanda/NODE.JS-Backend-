## 📁 1. What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a way to **connect safely** to another computer (like a server) over the internet.
You usually type something like this:

```bash
ssh user@192.168.1.10
```

But remembering many IP addresses can be hard — that’s where the **SSH config file** helps!

## ⚙️ 2. Where to keep settings

You can store your connection details inside this file:

```
~/.ssh/config
```

> `~` means your home folder.
> If the file doesn’t exist, you can create it.

## 🧩 3. Example of one server setup

```text
Host local-server
    HostName 192.168.1.10
    User sipun
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykey.pem
```

### What each line means:

* **Host** → your shortcut name (you’ll use this to connect)
* **HostName** → real IP or domain name of your server
* **User** → your login username
* **IdentityFile** → path to your private key

Now you can connect easily:

```bash
ssh local-server
```

✅ No need to remember the long IP or username again!

## 🌐 4. Adding more servers

You can add many servers in the same file:

```text
Host home
    HostName 203.0.113.50
    User sipun
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/home_key

Host office
    HostName 192.0.2.25
    User admin
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/office_key
```

Now just type:

```bash
ssh home
ssh office
```

---

## 🔒 5. Keep it safe

* The folder `~/.ssh` should have permission **700**
* The files inside should have **600**

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

---

## 🧠 6. Why this helps

✅ Easier to connect
✅ Safer (no need to type passwords or keys each time)
✅ Great for people managing multiple servers

## 🎉 7. Quick recap

| Command            | What it does                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `ssh user@ip`      | Normal way to connect        |
| `ssh local-server` | Shortcut using config file   |
| `~/.ssh/config`    | File where all settings live |
