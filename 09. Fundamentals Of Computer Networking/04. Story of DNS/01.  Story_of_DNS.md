## 📜 Before DNS: How Computers Talked on the Early Internet

In the early days of computer networking, before the internet as we know it existed, computers communicated over a **network called ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), which was developed in the late 1960s and 70s by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Back then, computers were identified by **numerical IP addresses** (e.g., `192.168.1.10`). If you wanted to connect to another machine, you had to know its **exact IP address**.

There was **no domain name**, no `google.com`, no `facebook.com`. Just **IP numbers**.

---

## 👩‍🔬 The Hosts File & Elizabeth Feinler's Contribution

To make communication between machines easier, a group of researchers at **Stanford Research Institute (SRI)** — including **Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler** — came up with a practical solution:
a **centralized text file** named `HOSTS.TXT`.

### 🗂️ What was `HOSTS.TXT`?

* A plain text file that **mapped human-readable hostnames to IP addresses**.
* For example:

  ```
  192.0.2.1     stanford.edu
  192.0.2.2     mit.edu
  ```

This file was maintained **manually** by Elizabeth Feinler’s team. Whenever a new computer was added to the ARPANET, its administrator would **call or email Feinler’s office** to request an entry in the file.

The file was:

* **Publicly accessible**
* **Shared with everyone** on the network
* Downloaded regularly by connected machines

### 🔧 How Connection Worked Back Then

To connect to a remote system:

* You used **terminal programs** like **Telnet**
* You entered the **IP address** of the remote machine
* If a domain name existed in `HOSTS.TXT`, your computer could resolve it to an IP

Even with `HOSTS.TXT`, **you still had to "dial in" manually**, so this wasn’t scalable.

## 🏷️ Categorization of Domains

To make the `HOSTS.TXT` file easier to manage, Feinler’s team started **categorizing domain names** by their purpose:

| Domain | Use Case                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `.com` | Commercial organizations        |
| `.gov` | Government agencies (e.g. NASA) |
| `.org` | Non-profit organizations        |
| `.edu` | Educational institutions        |
| `.mil` | Military                        |
| `.net` | Network infrastructure          |

This basic structure is **still used today** as the **top-level domains (TLDs)** of the internet.

## 🧠 The Problem with Manual Mapping

By the **late 1970s and early 1980s**, computers were connecting to ARPANET rapidly. The `HOSTS.TXT` file was:

* Growing too large
* Frequently outdated
* Difficult to manage manually

System admins would literally **call Feinler’s office** to get their systems listed or updated. Imagine that in today's world with billions of devices — clearly not scalable.

That’s when the **need for a better system** became obvious.

---

## 🌍 The Birth of DNS (Domain Name System)

In 1983, **Paul Mockapetris**, a computer scientist, proposed a new system to solve this scalability problem.

### 🎯 His Idea:

* Instead of one central file, create a **distributed, hierarchical naming system**.
* Allow **domain names to be resolved dynamically**, without updating every single computer.
* Each organization could **host its own records**, reducing the need for a central authority.

Thus, the **Domain Name System (DNS)** was born.

---

## 🏛️ What is DNS?

DNS stands for **Domain Name System**. It acts like the **phone book of the internet**.

### 📌 What It Does:

* Maps **domain names** (like `google.com`) to **IP addresses** (like `142.250.64.78`)
* Allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names
* Works **automatically and behind the scenes**

You just type `x.com` in your browser → DNS resolves it → You’re connected to the right server.

---

## 🔄 How DNS Works (Simplified Flow)

Here’s what happens when you type `x.com` into your browser:

1. **Browser checks cache**
   It first checks if it already knows the IP of `x.com`.

2. **OS checks local `/etc/hosts` file**
   Still a modern-day legacy of `HOSTS.TXT`.

3. **Query sent to Recursive DNS Resolver**
   Often operated by your ISP or Google (8.8.8.8).

4. **Resolver checks DNS hierarchy**:

   * Asks **root DNS servers** → who handles `.com`?
   * Then asks **.com name servers** → who handles `x.com`?
   * Then asks `x.com`’s authoritative name server → what's its IP?

5. **Resolver returns IP to browser**

6. **Browser makes an HTTP request** to the IP
   And the page loads!

---

## 🔄 The Telnet Integration Phase

In the transition period, even as DNS was coming into use, many people were still using **Telnet** to access other systems.

Previously, you had to enter the IP manually in Telnet.

But now, with DNS:

* You could enter a **domain name** (`telnet ford.com`)
* The system would **resolve the IP for you** automatically
* Manual lookup of `HOSTS.TXT` was no longer necessary

That’s when `HOSTS.TXT` became **obsolete**, and the modern DNS replaced it completely.

## 🧭 Summary Timeline

| Year      | Milestone                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| \~1970    | ARPANET begins                              |
| 1972–1980 | `HOSTS.TXT` maintained by Elizabeth Feinler |
| 1983      | Paul Mockapetris invents DNS                |
| 1984      | DNS fully replaces `HOSTS.TXT`              |
| Today     | DNS powers the global internet              |

## 🎯 Why DNS Is So Important

* Makes the web **human-friendly**: easy-to-remember domain names
* Powers **email, websites, APIs**, and nearly everything online
* Allows the internet to **scale globally**
* Enables **load balancing, failover, and distributed systems**

## 🧠 Final Thought

If DNS didn’t exist, we’d still be typing things like:

```
http://142.250.64.78
```

instead of:

```
https://google.com
```

Thanks to pioneers like **Elizabeth Feinler** and **Paul Mockapetris**, we have a reliable, scalable, and automated way to navigate the internet.
