### **📌 Explanation of `readStream.on("end", callback)` in Node.js Readable Streams**  

The `"end"` event in a **Readable Stream** is triggered when the stream **has been fully read**, and **there is no more data left to read**. This event signals that the **EOF (End of File) condition has been reached**.

---

## **📌 When does the `"end"` event fire?**
The `"end"` event fires when:  
1. **All data from the source has been completely read**.  
2. **No more data is available in the internal buffer**.  
3. **The Readable Stream is in flowing mode (`on("data")` is used) OR manual reading (`read()`) has finished.**  

**The `"end"` event does NOT mean that the stream is closed!**  
- The stream **remains open** until it is explicitly destroyed or closed.  
- The `"close"` event will fire only when the file descriptor is released.  

---

## **📌 Example Code for `"end"` Event:**
```js
import fs from 'fs';

// Creating a readable stream with a small buffer size
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("sample.txt", { highWaterMark: 4, encoding: "utf-8" });

console.log("Start reading file...");

// Handling 'data' event (stream is in flowing mode)
readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

// Handling 'end' event
readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("No more data to read. Stream reached the end.");
});

// Handling 'close' event
readStream.on("close", () => {
    console.log("Stream closed.");
});
```

## **📌 Output Example:**
```
Start reading file...
Received chunk: Hell
Received chunk: o, w
Received chunk: orld
Received chunk: !
No more data to read. Stream reached the end.
Stream closed.
```
🔹 Here, `"end"` is fired after the last chunk is processed, indicating that all data has been read.

## **📌 Key Points to Remember About `"end"` Event**
1️⃣ The `"end"` event fires when all data has been read from the stream.  
2️⃣ It means the **EOF (End of File)** is reached, but the stream is still open.  
3️⃣ If the stream is manually destroyed using `readStream.destroy()`, the `"end"` event **will NOT fire**.  
4️⃣ The `"close"` event is separate and will fire **only when the stream is closed**.

### **Why does the `"end"` event fire before the `"close"` event in a Readable Stream?**

In Node.js Readable Streams, the `"end"` and `"close"` events serve different purposes and are triggered at distinct stages of the stream lifecycle.

#### **1️⃣ `"end"` Event**  
- The `"end"` event fires **when the stream has read and emitted all the data**.  
- At this point, the internal buffer is empty, and no more data will be available to read.  
- This event only occurs **if the stream ends normally** (i.e., without being manually destroyed).  

#### **2️⃣ `"close"` Event**  
- The `"close"` event fires **when the underlying file descriptor (FD) is closed**.  
- This happens **after the `"end"` event** because closing a file descriptor is a cleanup operation performed after the stream has finished emitting all data.  
- It is not guaranteed to fire unless the stream was created from a file or explicitly destroyed.

---

### **🔹 Understanding the Order**
1. **The `"end"` event fires first** because the stream signals that it has **fully read and processed all data**.  
2. **The `"close"` event fires afterward** when Node.js cleans up the stream and releases system resources (like file descriptors).

---

### **Example Code Demonstrating This Behavior**
```js
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("chars.txt");

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Data:", chunk.toString());
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("✅ End Event: No more data to read.");
});

readStream.on("close", () => {
    console.log("🔒 Close Event: Stream resources released.");
});
```

### **🔹 Output**
```
Data: (first chunk of file)
Data: (next chunk of file)
...
✅ End Event: No more data to read.
🔒 Close Event: Stream resources released.
```

---

### **💡 Key Takeaways**
- `"end"` fires **when the stream finishes reading all data**.
- `"close"` fires **when the file descriptor is closed and resources are released**.
- **A stream can emit `"end"` but not `"close"`** if it is manually destroyed before completing.
