### **In Node.js, the `Readable` stream is an abstraction used for reading data from a source. The `readStream.on()` method is used to register event listeners for different stream events. These events are fired based on various stages or actions of the stream, such as data being available, stream error, or stream completion. **

### **Common Events in Readable Streams**

#### 1. **`data` Event**
   - **Fires**: When there is data available to be read from the stream.
   - **Why**: This event is emitted whenever a chunk of data is available in the internal buffer.
   - **Usage**: The `data` event is typically used to consume the data from the stream.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
       console.log(chunk);  // Outputs the chunk of data read from the stream
     });
     ```

#### 2. **`end` Event**
   - **Fires**: When the stream has finished reading all data and has no more data to provide.
   - **Why**: This event is emitted when the stream reaches its end. After this event, the stream will not emit any more data.
   - **Usage**: Typically used to clean up or finalize processes after reading all data.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('end', () => {
       console.log('Stream has finished reading all data');
     });
     ```

#### 3. **`close` Event**
   - **Fires**: When the underlying resource (file, network socket, etc.) is closed after all operations have finished.
   - **Why**: This event is emitted when the stream is fully closed, and there’s no more possibility of reading data. This could happen after calling `.destroy()` or after the stream naturally ends.
   - **Usage**: Useful for cleaning up resources or performing final operations once the stream is no longer in use.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('close', () => {
       console.log('Stream has been closed');
     });
     ```

#### 4. **`error` Event**
   - **Fires**: When an error occurs during reading or processing the stream.
   - **Why**: This event is emitted if there is an issue with reading from the stream or if there’s an unexpected error (e.g., file not found, permission denied).
   - **Usage**: To handle errors gracefully and avoid uncaught exceptions.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('error', (error) => {
       console.error('An error occurred:', error);
     });
     ```

#### 5. **`open` Event**
   - **Fires**: When the underlying resource (such as a file or network connection) is opened and the stream is ready to be used.
   - **Why**: This event indicates that the stream has successfully connected to the underlying resource and is ready for reading.
   - **Usage**: This is typically useful for debugging or logging, as it confirms the stream is open.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('open', (fd) => {
       console.log('Stream opened, file descriptor:', fd);
     });
     ```

#### 6. **`ready` Event** (For Some Streams)
   - **Fires**: When the stream is ready to start consuming or producing data. This is typically used with streams that rely on external factors, like file systems or network operations.
   - **Why**: Indicates that the stream is ready and able to process or produce data.
   - **Usage**: Usually used for readiness checking before starting processing on streams.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('ready', () => {
       console.log('Stream is now ready');
     });
     ```

#### 7. **`pause` Event**
   - **Fires**: When the stream has been paused. This happens if the `.pause()` method is called on the stream, indicating that no more data will be read until `.resume()` is called.
   - **Why**: Used to stop the stream from automatically flowing data. It can be useful when you want to control the pace at which data is consumed.
   - **Usage**: You can use this event to handle situations where you want to pause the data flow until you're ready for more.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('pause', () => {
       console.log('Stream has been paused');
     });
     ```

#### 8. **`resume` Event**
   - **Fires**: When the stream has resumed from a paused state. This happens after calling `.resume()` on a paused stream.
   - **Why**: To signal that the flow of data will continue after a pause.
   - **Usage**: Can be used to notify when the stream resumes processing data.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('resume', () => {
       console.log('Stream has resumed');
     });
     ```

#### 9. **`readable` Event**
   - **Fires**: When the stream has data available to be read, i.e., the internal buffer is filled or ready for consumption.
   - **Why**: This event is useful when you want to check if data is available to read but don’t necessarily want to consume it immediately (e.g., when you’re handling the internal buffer manually).
   - **Usage**: Can be used for custom data processing when you need to check if the stream is ready to emit data.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.on('readable', () => {
       let chunk;
       while (null !== (chunk = readStream.read())) {
         console.log(chunk);
       }
     });
     ```

| Event Name   | When it Fires                                                                 | Example Usage                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

In addition to the events associated with `Readable` streams in Node.js, there are several important properties that you can use to manage and interact with the stream's state. Below is an explanation of the key properties of `Readable` streams, what they are, when they are useful, and their behavior.

### **1. `readableHighWaterMark`**
   - **Description**: Represents the maximum amount of data the internal buffer can hold before it triggers a backpressure situation. This is set when you create a stream.
   - **Default**: The default value is `16 * 1024` (16KB) for streams unless overridden.
   - **When to Use**: Useful for controlling how much data the stream will buffer before it stops accepting new data (backpressure). You can adjust this value if you need to control memory usage or want to handle larger or smaller chunks.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt', { highWaterMark: 8 });
     console.log(readStream.readableHighWaterMark); // Outputs: 8
     ```

### **2. `readableLength`**
   - **Description**: This property returns the number of bytes currently in the internal buffer that are available to be read.
   - **When to Use**: You can use this to check how much data is available in the internal buffer, useful for custom flow control or checking buffer status.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     console.log(readStream.readableLength); // Outputs the current length of data in the buffer
     ```

### **3. `readableFlowing`**
   - **Description**: This property indicates whether the stream is in flowing mode or paused mode. If the stream is in flowing mode, the `data` event will be emitted automatically when data is available.
   - **Values**: 
     - `null`: The stream is in paused mode.
     - `true`: The stream is in flowing mode, and `data` events will be emitted.
     - `false`: The stream is in paused mode, and you need to call `.read()` to get the data.
   - **When to Use**: You can check this property to see if data is actively being consumed by the stream or if it is paused.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // Outputs: null, true, or false depending on stream state
     ```

### **4. `readableEnded`**
   - **Description**: This property indicates whether the stream has finished reading all data and has ended.
   - **When to Use**: You can check this property to see if the stream has ended, typically used after the `end` event fires to verify that no more data will be available.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     console.log(readStream.readableEnded); // Outputs: true if the stream has ended, false otherwise
     ```

### **5. `readableObjectMode`**
   - **Description**: A boolean property that tells you whether the stream is in object mode. If `true`, the stream will emit JavaScript objects instead of `Buffer` objects or strings.
   - **Default**: `false` (the stream will emit data as `Buffer` objects by default).
   - **When to Use**: Use this property when working with streams that produce non-binary data (e.g., objects, arrays) to determine how the stream behaves.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt', { objectMode: true });
     console.log(readStream.readableObjectMode); // Outputs: true or false
     ```

### **6. `isPaused()`**
   - **Description**: A method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the stream is currently paused.
   - **When to Use**: You can use this method to determine whether you need to call `.resume()` on the stream to continue reading data.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     console.log(readStream.isPaused()); // Outputs: true if the stream is paused, false otherwise
     ```

### **7. `pipe`**
   - **Description**: The `pipe` method is used to transfer data from the readable stream to a writable stream automatically. It pipes the data until the readable stream ends or the writable stream encounters an error.
   - **When to Use**: This method is useful when you want to forward the data to another stream (e.g., writing data to a file or sending it over HTTP).
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
     readStream.pipe(writeStream); // Pipes data from the read stream to the write stream
     ```

### **8. `read()`**
   - **Description**: The `read()` method is used to read a specific number of bytes from the internal buffer of the stream. If the stream is paused, this method can be used to manually read data.
   - **When to Use**: Use this method when the stream is paused and you want to consume the data manually or when you want to control how much data is read.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const chunk = readStream.read(4); // Reads 4 bytes from the internal buffer
     console.log(chunk); // Logs the first 4 bytes of data
     ```

### **9. `destroy()`**
   - **Description**: The `destroy()` method is used to destroy the stream. Once destroyed, the stream can no longer emit events or provide data.
   - **Arguments**: 
     - **`error`** (optional): You can pass an error message that will be emitted via the `error` event, notifying that the stream has been destroyed due to an error.
   - **When to Use**: Use this method when you want to terminate a stream, typically when encountering an error or when you no longer need to consume data from the stream.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.destroy(); // Destroys the stream without an error
     readStream.destroy(new Error('Something went wrong')); // Destroys the stream with an error
     ```

### **10. `unpipe()`**
   - **Description**: The `unpipe()` method removes the attached writable stream from the readable stream, stopping the flow of data to the writable stream.
   - **When to Use**: You can use this method when you no longer want data to be piped to a writable stream.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     readStream.unpipe(writeStream); // Stops data from being piped to writeStream
     ```
