## 📌 **Understanding `readStream.on("close", callback)` in Readable Streams**  

The `"close"` event in a **Readable Stream** is emitted when the stream and its underlying resource (e.g., a file descriptor) have been closed.  

---

### **🔹 When Does the `"close"` Event Fire?**  
The `"close"` event fires when:
1. The stream has been **fully read**, and Node.js automatically closes it.  
2. The stream is **explicitly destroyed** using `readStream.destroy()`.  
3. An **error occurs**, causing the stream to close.  
4. The stream is manually closed using **`fs.close()`** (though this is uncommon with `fs.createReadStream`).  

---

### **🔹 Example: Close Event Firing After `end`**
```js
import fs from "fs";

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("chars.txt", { encoding: "utf-8" });

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

// The "end" event fires when all data has been read.
readStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log("Stream has ended.");
});

// The "close" event fires when the underlying resource is closed.
readStream.on("close", () => {
  console.log("Stream closed.");
});
```
**📝 Output:**  
```
Received chunk: (data from file)
Stream has ended.
Stream closed.
```
### **📌 Why Does `"close"` Fire After `"end"`?**  
- `"end"` event signals that the stream has **finished reading** all data.  
- `"close"` event occurs after `"end"`, meaning the **file descriptor is closed** and the stream is no longer usable.  

---

### **🔹 Example: Close Event When Destroying a Stream**
```js
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("chars.txt");

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log("Reading:", chunk);
  readStream.destroy();  // Manually destroying the stream
});

readStream.on("close", () => {
  console.log("Stream closed after destroy.");
});
```
**📝 Output:**  
```
Reading: (first chunk)
Stream closed after destroy.
```
### **📌 Why Did `"close"` Fire Here?**  
- The stream was manually destroyed using `readStream.destroy()`, which **forcibly closes the stream** and emits the `"close"` event immediately.  

---

### **🔹 When to Use the `"close"` Event?**  
✅ **Cleaning up resources** when a stream is no longer needed.  
✅ **Logging or debugging** when a stream is properly closed.  
✅ **Ensuring the file descriptor is released** after stream processing.

# 📌 **Understanding `readStream.close()` and `readStream.pause()` in Readable Streams**  

In **Node.js Readable Streams**, we have methods to control the stream's behavior:  

- **`readStream.close()`** → Manually closes the stream and releases resources.  
- **`readStream.pause()`** → Temporarily stops the stream from emitting `"data"` events.  

---

## 🔹 **1. `readStream.close()` - Manually Closing a Stream**  
### 📌 **What is `readStream.close()`?**  
- `readStream.close()` is used to **manually close** a readable stream and free up system resources (like file descriptors).  
- It triggers the `"close"` event, signaling that the stream is fully closed.  
- Unlike `readStream.destroy()`, it **only closes the stream when it's safe to do so** (i.e., after reading all data).  

### ✅ **Example: Using `readStream.close()`**
```js
import fs from "fs";

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("chars.txt");

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log("Reading:", chunk);
  readStream.close();  // Manually closing the stream
});

readStream.on("close", () => {
  console.log("Stream closed manually.");
});
```
### 📝 **Output:**
```
Reading: (first chunk)
Stream closed manually.
```
### 📌 **When to Use `close()`?**
✅ When **you don't want to read the entire file** but need to close the stream cleanly.  
✅ When you **no longer need the stream**, and you want to **free system resources**.  

---

## 🔹 **2. `readStream.pause()` - Temporarily Pausing the Stream**  
### 📌 **What is `readStream.pause()`?**  
- `readStream.pause()` **pauses the flow** of data in a readable stream.  
- The `"data"` event **stops emitting chunks**, but the internal buffer **may still contain data**.  
- You can **resume the stream** later using `readStream.resume()`.  

### ✅ **Example: Using `pause()`**
```js
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("chars.txt", { encoding: "utf-8" });

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log("Reading:", chunk);
  readStream.pause();  // Pause the stream
  console.log("Stream paused.");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Resuming stream...");
    readStream.resume();  // Resume after 2 seconds
  }, 2000);
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log("Stream has ended.");
});
```
### 📝 **Output:**
```
Reading: (first chunk)
Stream paused.
(Waits 2 seconds)
Resuming stream...
Reading: (next chunk)
...
Stream has ended.
```
### 📌 **When to Use `pause()`?**
✅ When processing **large files** and want to **control the reading speed**.  
✅ When you need to **pause processing temporarily** (e.g., waiting for an external API to process data).  
✅ When dealing with **backpressure** (preventing memory overflow).

## **🔹 `pause()` vs `close()` - Key Differences**
| Feature            | `pause()` | `close()` |
|--------------------|----------|----------|
| **Effect**        | Temporarily stops reading | Fully closes the stream |
| **Can Resume?**   | ✅ Yes, using `resume()` | ❌ No, once closed, cannot resume |
| **Emits "data"?** | ❌ No, while paused | ❌ No, after closing |
| **Emits "close"?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Use Case**      | Pausing for processing control | Releasing resources |
