### üìå **Detailed Notes on `highWaterMark` in Node.js Streams**  

#### üîπ **What is `highWaterMark`?**  
The `highWaterMark` option in Node.js streams is a property that controls the buffer size of a readable or writable stream. It determines how much data can be read or written at a time before pausing or resuming the flow of data.  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Default Buffer Size (`highWaterMark`) in Streams**
- In Node.js, when using `fs.createReadStream()` or `fs.createWriteStream()`, the default buffer size is **64 KB (65536 bytes)**.  
- This means that by default, the stream will read/write **64 KB** of data at a time.  

#### **Default Values for Different Stream Types:**
| Stream Type      | Default `highWaterMark` Size |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Readable Stream (fs.createReadStream)** | 64 KB (65536 bytes) |
| **Writable Stream (fs.createWriteStream)** | 16 KB (16384 bytes) |
| **TCP Sockets** | 64 KB (65536 bytes) |
| **zlib Streams (Compression/Decompression)** | 16 KB (16384 bytes) |
| **HTTP Incoming Request (req stream)** | 64 KB (65536 bytes) |
| **HTTP Response Stream (res stream)** | 64 KB (65536 bytes) |

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use `highWaterMark`?**
- **Performance Optimization**: Setting a larger buffer size reduces the number of read/write operations, improving efficiency.  
- **Memory Management**: If the buffer size is too large, it can lead to excessive memory usage, potentially crashing the system.  
- **Handling Large Files**: When working with large files, reading them in smaller chunks using streams prevents excessive memory consumption.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Customizing `highWaterMark`**
- We can explicitly set the buffer size in bytes while creating a stream.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  import fs from "fs";

  // Creating a readable stream with a custom buffer size of 100MB
  const readStream = fs.createReadStream("largeFile.zip", { highWaterMark: 100 * 1024 * 1024 });

  readStream.on("data", (chunkBuffer) => {
      console.log("Chunk received:", chunkBuffer.byteLength, "bytes");
  });
  ```

  üîπ **Explanation:**
  - `highWaterMark: 100 * 1024 * 1024` sets the buffer size to **100 MB**.  
  - The file will be read in **100 MB chunks** instead of the default **64 KB**.  
  - This reduces the number of read operations, which is beneficial for handling large files efficiently.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ When to Increase or Decrease `highWaterMark`?**
| Scenario | Suggested Buffer Size |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Processing Large Files (e.g., Videos, ZIPs, Large Logs)** | Increase `highWaterMark` (e.g., 10MB - 100MB) |
| **Handling Small Files (e.g., Text, JSON, Configs)** | Keep default (64 KB) or lower |
| **Streaming Real-Time Data (e.g., Live Video, WebSockets)** | Keep moderate (e.g., 256 KB - 1 MB) |
| **Memory-Constrained Environments** | Decrease to avoid high memory consumption |

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **By default, Node.js uses a buffer size of 64 KB for streams.**  
‚úÖ **We can modify `highWaterMark` to optimize performance and memory usage.**  
‚úÖ **Larger buffer size = Fewer operations but higher memory usage.**  
‚úÖ **Smaller buffer size = More operations but lower memory footprint.**  
‚úÖ **Find the right balance based on file size and system resources.**
