### Why don't we use `emitter.emit` in `readStream.on("data", callback)`?  

When we do this:  
```javascript
readStream.on("data", (chunkBuffer) => {
    console.log(chunkBuffer); // Logs the chunk of data being read
    console.log(chunkBuffer.byteLength); // Logs the size of the current chunk in bytes
});
```  
We're **listening** for the `"data"` event, but we don't explicitly **emit** it using `emitter.emit()`.  

#### **Reason: The Stream Object (readStream) Emits Events Internally**
- `fs.createReadStream()` **returns an instance of `fs.ReadStream`**, which is a subclass of `EventEmitter`.  
- Node.js **automatically emits events** when data is available.  
- The `"data"` event is **emitted internally by the stream itself** when it reads a chunk of data from the file.  

#### **How Does It Work?**
1. When `fs.createReadStream()` starts reading the file, it **internally emits** a `"data"` event whenever a chunk is available.  
2. Since we have **attached a listener** using `readStream.on("data", callback)`, our callback function executes every time data arrives.  
3. We donâ€™t need to manually emit `"data"` because the stream does it **automatically** when it processes the file.

### **When Do We Use `emitter.emit()`?**
We use `emitter.emit(eventName, data)` **only when we create a custom event emitter**. Example:  
```javascript
import { EventEmitter } from "events";

const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Listener for "customEvent"
myEmitter.on("customEvent", (data) => {
    console.log("Custom Event Triggered:", data);
});

// Manually emitting "customEvent"
myEmitter.emit("customEvent", "Hello, this is custom data!");
```
In this case, we need to use `emit()` because **Node.js does not automatically emit "customEvent"**â€”we created it manually.

### **Summary**
âœ… **Streams (like `fs.createReadStream`) automatically emit events like `"data"`, `"end"`, and `"error"`, so we don't need to manually emit them.**  
âœ… **We just need to attach listeners using `on(eventName, callback)`, and they will trigger when the event occurs.**  
âœ… **We use `emitter.emit()` only when defining our own custom events.**
