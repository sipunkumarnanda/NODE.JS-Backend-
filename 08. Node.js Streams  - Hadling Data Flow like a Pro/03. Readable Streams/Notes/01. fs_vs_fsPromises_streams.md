### **Why Use `import fs from "fs"` Instead of `"fs/promises"` in Streams?**  

In Node.js, both **`fs`** and **`fs/promises`** modules are used for handling file operations, but their usage differs based on how they handle asynchronous operations. Let's dive deep into both and understand **why `fs` is used in streams** instead of `fs/promises`.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Difference Between `fs` and `fs/promises`**
| Feature             | `fs` (Callback & Stream-Based) | `fs/promises` (Promise-Based) |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **API Type**        | Uses **callbacks & streams** | Uses **Promises & async/await** |
| **Streaming Support** | ‚úÖ **Supports streams** (e.g., `createReadStream`) | ‚ùå **Does not support streams** |
| **Blocking Behavior** | Can be **non-blocking** (with streams) | Can be **blocking** due to `await` |
| **Error Handling**  | Uses error-first callbacks or event listeners | Uses `try/catch` for error handling |
| **Use Case**        | Efficient for large files (due to streaming) | Suitable for small to medium files |

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Why `fs` is Used in Streams Instead of `fs/promises`?**  

### **A. `fs` Supports Streams (`createReadStream` and `createWriteStream`)**
Streams allow processing large files **piece by piece** instead of loading everything into memory. The `fs` module provides **stream-based** methods like:  
- `fs.createReadStream()` (to read files in chunks)  
- `fs.createWriteStream()` (to write files in chunks)  

‚ùå **`fs/promises` does NOT provide streaming methods**.  

üìå **Example: Reading a large file using streams (`fs`)**  
```js
import fs from "fs";

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("largeFile.txt", { highWaterMark: 64 * 1024 }); // 64KB chunks

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data`);
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Finished reading file");
});
```
‚úÖ **Why use `fs`?**  
- **Memory efficient**: Does not load the entire file into memory  
- **Fast processing**: Processes data as soon as it arrives  
- **Event-driven**: Uses `on("data")` to handle data in chunks  

‚ùå **Cannot use `fs/promises` here** because it does not provide **streaming methods**.

### **B. `fs/promises` Uses `readFile` and `writeFile` (No Streaming)**
The `fs/promises` module is useful for reading/writing **small to medium files** where we can load the entire content into memory at once.

üìå **Example: Reading a file using `fs/promises`**  
```js
import fs from "fs/promises";

async function readFile() {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile("largeFile.txt", "utf-8"); // Loads entire file into memory
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error reading file:", error);
    }
}

readFile();
```
‚ùå **Why NOT use `fs/promises` for large files?**  
- **Consumes a lot of memory**: Loads the **entire file** into memory  
- **Slow**: Must **wait** for the entire file to be read before processing  
- **Limited by system memory**: Can crash if file size is too large  

‚úÖ **Best for**:  
- Small configuration files (JSON, logs, etc.)  
- Reading files **once** and storing them in variables

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use `fs` vs `fs/promises`?**
| Scenario | Use `fs` (Streams) | Use `fs/promises` (Async/Await) |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Reading Large Files (1GB+)?** | ‚úÖ Yes (Efficient) | ‚ùå No (Memory Issues) |
| **Writing Large Files?** | ‚úÖ Yes (Streaming is better) | ‚ùå No (Can crash) |
| **Processing Data in Chunks?** | ‚úÖ Yes (Streaming supports chunk processing) | ‚ùå No (Only full-file reading) |
| **Reading Small Files (<10MB)?** | ‚ùå No (Overhead of events) | ‚úÖ Yes (Simple and easy) |
| **Need Async/Await Syntax?** | ‚ùå No (Uses events) | ‚úÖ Yes (Uses `await`) |

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion: Which One to Use?**
‚úÖ **Use `fs` (streams) when:**  
- Reading/writing **large files** (100MB - GBs)  
- You need to **process data in chunks**  
- You want **memory-efficient** file handling  

‚úÖ **Use `fs/promises` when:**  
- Dealing with **small files** (logs, configs, JSON)  
- You need **simpler async/await syntax**  
- You don't need to process data in chunks  

---

### **Final Thought üí°**
**For handling large files efficiently, always use `fs` with streams (`createReadStream` and `createWriteStream`).** If you're only dealing with small files, `fs/promises` is simpler and works well with async/await. üöÄ
