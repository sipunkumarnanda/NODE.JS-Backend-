### **📌 Why Should We Close a Writable Stream?**  

When we use a writable stream, we are sending data in chunks instead of all at once. But once we're done writing, we **must close the stream properly**. If we don’t, it can cause problems like memory waste, incomplete file writing, or programs getting stuck.

### **🔹 What Happens If We Don’t Close It?**  

1️⃣ **Wasted Memory (Resources Stay Occupied)** 🛑  
   - When a stream is open, it **reserves memory and system resources**.  
   - If we forget to close it, the program **keeps using memory unnecessarily**.  

2️⃣ **Risk of Data Loss (Not Everything is Saved)** ❌  
   - Streams don’t always write data **immediately**. Some data stays in a **buffer** before being written to a file.  
   - If we don’t close the stream, **this buffered data may never get saved**.  

3️⃣ **Program May Keep Running Forever** ⏳  
   - Some processes **wait** for the stream to close before finishing.  
   - If we forget to close it, the program may **never stop running**.  

4️⃣ **Files May Get Corrupted** ⚠️  
   - If writing to a file is interrupted (e.g., power loss, crash), the file may end up **half-written** or **corrupted**.

### **🔹 How Do We Close a Writable Stream?**  

👉 The best way to **properly close a writable stream** is by using `.end()`. This ensures that:  
✅ **All remaining data is written**  
✅ **Resources are freed**  
✅ **The stream is closed properly**  

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('example.txt');

writeStream.write('Hello, World!'); // Writing data to the file

writeStream.end(); // 🚀 Closes the stream properly
```

### **🔹 What Does `.end()` Do?**  
🔹 `.end()` **flushes all remaining data** and **closes the stream**.  
🔹 After calling `.end()`, the stream **cannot accept more data**.  

✅ **Good Practice:** Always call `.end()` when done writing.

### **📌 Final Thoughts**  
**Closing a writable stream is VERY important!** 🚀  
- It **prevents memory waste**  
- It **ensures all data is saved**  
- It **prevents the program from hanging**  
- It **keeps files safe from corruption**  

So, **always close the stream using `.end()`** when you're done writing! 🎯
