### **Understanding `writeStream` Events in Node.js** 🚀  

When working with writable streams in Node.js, there are key lifecycle events that help us understand **when a stream starts, completes writing, and closes properly**.  

---

## **1️⃣ `writeStream.on("open")`** 🔓  
### **When does it fire?**  
- It fires **when the writable stream is first opened** and a **file descriptor** is assigned by the OS.  
- This happens **before any data is written**.  

### **Why is it useful?**  
- It confirms that the file or stream is ready for writing.  
- You can use this event to perform **preparations** before writing data.  

### **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("example.txt");

writeStream.on("open", (fd) => {
    console.log(`Stream opened! File Descriptor: ${fd}`);
    writeStream.write("Hello, World!");
});
```
✅ **Output:**  
```
Stream opened! File Descriptor: 3
```

## **2️⃣ `writeStream.on("finish")`** ✅  
### **When does it fire?**  
- It fires **after all data has been written to the file**, and **`writeStream.end()` is called**.  
- It indicates that **writing is complete**, but the stream is **still open**.  

### **Why is it useful?**  
- You can use this event to **log a success message** or **trigger further processing**.  

### **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("example.txt");

writeStream.on("finish", () => {
    console.log("All data has been written!");
});

writeStream.write("Hello, ");
writeStream.write("World!");
writeStream.end(); // Triggers "finish" event
```
✅ **Output:**  
```
All data has been written!
```

## **3️⃣ `writeStream.on("close")`** 🔒  
### **When does it fire?**  
- It fires when **the stream is completely closed**, meaning all resources (file descriptor) are released.  
- This happens **after the `finish` event**.  

### **Why is it useful?**  
- Ensures that the file is completely **closed and safe to be accessed elsewhere**.  
- Helps in **debugging leaks** when working with streams.  

### **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("example.txt");

writeStream.on("finish", () => {
    console.log("Writing done, but stream is still open...");
});

writeStream.on("close", () => {
    console.log("Stream fully closed. Resources released.");
});

writeStream.write("Hello, Node.js!");
writeStream.end();
```
✅ **Output:**  
```
Writing done, but stream is still open...
Stream fully closed. Resources released.
```

## **🎯 Summary of Event Order**  

| Event          | When it Fires?                                 | Purpose                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `open` 🔓     | When the stream is first created (before writing starts). | Confirms file descriptor is assigned. |
| `finish` ✅    | When writing **finishes**, but the stream is still open. | Confirms all data is written. |
| `close` 🔒    | When the stream is fully closed and resources are freed. | Confirms no further operations can happen. |

---

## **📌 Key Takeaways**
✔ `open` → Fires **first** when the file is opened.  
✔ `finish` → Fires when writing **is done**, but the file isn't closed yet.  
✔ `close` → Fires **last**, ensuring the stream is completely **closed and cleaned up**.  

Using these events properly ensures **safe and efficient** file operations in Node.js! 🚀
