### **Understanding `finish` and `close` Events in Writable Streams** 🚀  

When working with writable streams in Node.js, **two important events** are fired when closing a stream:  

1️⃣ **`finish` event** – Fired **when all data has been written to the underlying system**.  
2️⃣ **`close` event** – Fired **when the file descriptor is released and the stream is completely closed**.  

---

## **🔹 `finish` Event: Ensures All Writes are Done**
- The `finish` event is emitted **when all write operations have been flushed** to the file.  
- This means that **all `write()` calls have been processed**, and the stream is about to close.  
- **It does not necessarily mean the file descriptor is closed yet.**  

### **Example: Handling `finish` Event**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a writable stream
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('example.txt');

// Write some data
writeStream.write('Hello, this is the first line.\n');
writeStream.write('Writing another line of text.\n');

// Close the writable stream
writeStream.end(() => {
    console.log('✅ Stream has finished writing data.');
});

// Listen for the `finish` event
writeStream.on('finish', () => {
    console.log('✅ `finish` event fired: All data written to the file.');
});
```

**📝 What happens here?**  
1️⃣ **`write()` writes data** to the file.  
2️⃣ **`end()` is called**, signaling no more writes will be performed.  
3️⃣ **Once all writes are flushed**, the `finish` event fires.  
4️⃣ **At this point, the file descriptor is still open**, but writing is complete.

## **🔹 `close` Event: Ensures the File Descriptor is Released**
- The `close` event **only fires after the file descriptor is fully released**.  
- This means that **resources tied to the file are cleaned up**.  
- If the file was manually closed (`writeStream.close()`), then `close` fires only after that.  

### **Example: Handling `close` Event**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a writable stream
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('example.txt');

// Write some data
writeStream.write('Some content being written...\n');

// Close the stream
writeStream.end(() => {
    console.log('✅ Stream has finished writing data.');
});

// Listen for the `close` event
writeStream.on('close', () => {
    console.log('✅ `close` event fired: File descriptor released.');
});
```

## **🔹 Difference Between `finish` and `close`**
| Event     | When it Fires 🚀 | What it Means 🔍 |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| `finish`  | When all data has been **written to the underlying file system** | **Writing is complete, but the file descriptor is still open** |
| `close`   | When the **file descriptor is fully closed and released** | **The stream is completely closed and cleaned up** |

---

## **✅ Summary: When to Use Which?**
- **Use `finish`** if you want to **execute code after all data has been written**.  
- **Use `close`** if you want to **execute code only after the stream and file descriptor are fully closed**.  

These events are essential for **managing resources efficiently** in a Node.js application. 🚀
