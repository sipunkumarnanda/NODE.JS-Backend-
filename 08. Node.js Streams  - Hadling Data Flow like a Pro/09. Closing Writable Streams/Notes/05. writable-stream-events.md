### **All Events of Writable Stream (`writeStream.on("event", callback)`)** 🔥  

A **writable stream** in Node.js emits several events during its lifecycle. Let's go through each of them in order:  

---

## **1️⃣ `"open"` Event** 🏁  
💡 **When?**  
- Fired **when the stream is successfully opened** and a **file descriptor (fd)** is assigned.  

💻 **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

writeStream.on("open", (fd) => {
    console.log("Stream opened! File descriptor:", fd);
});
```
✅ **Use Case:**  
- To **confirm** that the file/stream has been opened and is ready for writing.  

---

## **2️⃣ `"drain"` Event** 🚰  
💡 **When?**  
- If `.write()` returns `false`, it means the internal buffer is **full**.  
- When the buffer **empties** and can accept more data, `"drain"` fires.  

💻 **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

const largeData = "a".repeat(1e6); // 1 million 'a's

const canWrite = writeStream.write(largeData);
if (!canWrite) {
    console.log("Buffer full, waiting for drain...");
    writeStream.on("drain", () => {
        console.log("Buffer drained, ready for more data!");
    });
}
```
✅ **Use Case:**  
- Used in **high-performance** writing operations to prevent memory overload.  

---

## **3️⃣ `"finish"` Event** 🏁  
💡 **When?**  
- Fired **when all data has been flushed to the file** and `.end()` has been called.  

💻 **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

writeStream.write("Hello, world!");
writeStream.end(); // Signals no more data will be written

writeStream.on("finish", () => {
    console.log("All data written, stream finished!");
});
```
✅ **Use Case:**  
- **Confirm** that writing has fully completed before taking further actions.  

---

## **4️⃣ `"close"` Event** 🔒  
💡 **When?**  
- Fired **after `"finish"`** and **when the underlying file descriptor is closed**.  

💻 **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

writeStream.write("Hello, world!");
writeStream.end();

writeStream.on("finish", () => console.log("Finish event fired"));
writeStream.on("close", () => console.log("Close event fired"));
```
✅ **Use Case:**  
- Ensures **all file resources are released properly**.  

🚨 **Difference Between `"finish"` and `"close"`**  
- `"finish"` means **writing is done**.  
- `"close"` means **file descriptor is released**.  

---

## **5️⃣ `"error"` Event** ❌  
💡 **When?**  
- If there is an **error while writing**, this event fires.  

💻 **Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("/restricted/output.txt"); // Invalid path

writeStream.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("Error writing file:", err.message);
});
```
✅ **Use Case:**  
- Always handle errors **gracefully** to prevent crashes.

## **Final Summary Table** 📝  

| Event Name  | When Does It Fire? | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| `"open"`  | When the stream opens | Confirm file is open |
| `"drain"` | When internal buffer is empty | Efficient large data writing |
| `"finish"` | After `.end()` is called | Confirm all writing is done |
| `"close"`  | When the file descriptor is released | Ensure proper resource cleanup |
| `"error"`  | If an error occurs | Handle file writing errors |
