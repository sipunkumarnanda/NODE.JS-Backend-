# **Using Redirection: `node app.js < output.txt`**  

## **Understanding `<` (Input Redirection) in Shell**  
The `<` operator is used in the shell to **redirect the contents of a file** as **input** to a program. This means that instead of manually typing input, the program reads input from a specified file.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Command:**
```bash
node app.js < output.txt
```
ðŸ”¹ **What Happens Here?**  
- `output.txt` contains some **pre-existing data**.  
- The `<` operator redirects the content of `output.txt` as **standard input (stdin)** to `node app.js`.  
- Inside `app.js`, `process.stdin` will **read** the contents of `output.txt` instead of waiting for user input.

## **ðŸ“Œ Example: Using `<` in Node.js**
### **Step 1: Create a File `output.txt` with Some Data**
```bash
echo "Hello from output.txt" > output.txt
```
Now, `output.txt` contains:
```
Hello from output.txt
```

### **Step 2: Create `app.js` to Read from `stdin`**
```javascript
process.stdin.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received Input:", chunk.toString());
});
```

### **Step 3: Run the Command**
```bash
node app.js < output.txt
```
### **Output in Terminal:**
```
Received Input: Hello from output.txt
```

## **ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways**  
âœ… The `<` operator redirects a file's content **as input (stdin) to a program**.  
âœ… In **Node.js**, `process.stdin` will read from the specified file **instead of the keyboard**.  
âœ… Useful for **automating input**, reading **pre-stored data**, and testing programs.
