# **Redirection in Node.js and Shell**  

## **What is Redirection?**  
Redirection is a mechanism that allows us to **send the output of a process to a file** instead of displaying it in the terminal. Similarly, we can use redirection to **read input from a file instead of typing manually**.  

It works using special symbols:  
- **`>`** Redirects output to a file (overwrite mode).  
- **`>>`** Redirects output to a file (append mode).  
- **`<`** Redirects input from a file.  
- **`<<`** Used for "Here Document" input redirection.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Redirecting Output to a File (`>`)**  
```bash
node script.js > output.txt
```
üîπ **What happens here?**  
- `node script.js` runs and generates output.  
- `>` redirects the output from `stdout` to `output.txt`.  
- If `output.txt` **already exists, it will be overwritten**.  

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Appending Output to a File (`>>`)**  
```bash
node script.js >> output.txt
```
üîπ **What happens here?**  
- Instead of overwriting, `>>` **appends** the output to `output.txt`.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Redirecting Input from a File (`<`)**  
```bash
node script.js < input.txt
```
üîπ **What happens here?**  
- Instead of reading from the keyboard (`stdin`), `script.js` reads input from `input.txt`.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Combining Redirection and Piping**  
```bash
ls | node app.js > output.txt
```
üîπ **What happens here?**  
1. `ls` lists the files in the directory.  
2. The **pipe (`|`)** sends the output of `ls` to `node app.js`.  
3. The `>` **redirects** the final output of `app.js` into `output.txt`.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Key Differences: Piping (`|`) vs. Redirection (`>` `<`)**  

| Feature         | Piping (`|`)                      | Redirection (`>` `<`)            |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Purpose        | Pass output from one process to another | Redirect output/input to/from a file |
| Works With     | Two or more processes           | Files and processes             |
| Example       | `ls | node app.js`               | `node script.js > output.txt`   |

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**  
‚úÖ **Redirection (`>` `<` `>>`) is used for file I/O**.  
‚úÖ **Piping (`|`) is used for passing data between processes**.  
‚úÖ You can **combine both piping and redirection** to process data efficiently.
