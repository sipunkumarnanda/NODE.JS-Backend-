### ** Code Explanation ** 

```javascript 

import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("chars.txt", { highWaterMark: 4 });

// Readable event listener
readStream.on("readable", () => {
    // Logs the current size of the internal buffer.
    // Initially, it's 4 bytes because we set the highWaterMark to 4.
    console.log(readStream.readableLength);  // Logs: 4
    
    // Reads 1 byte of data from the internal buffer. 
    // The internal buffer size is initially 4 bytes, so after reading 1 byte, 
    // the remaining data in the buffer would be 3 bytes.
    console.log(readStream.read(1));  // Logs: the first byte of data (could be a Buffer)

    // Logs the remaining length of data in the internal buffer after calling read(1).
    // After reading 1 byte, it should be 0 because only 1 byte was read.
    console.log(readStream.readableLength);  // Logs: 0
});

```
### Explanation of the Code and Behavior:

You are working with a `Readable` stream that reads from `chars.txt` using `highWaterMark: 4`, which means the stream will fill its internal buffer in chunks of 4 bytes at a time. Here’s what happens during the execution:

1. **Initial Setup**:
    - The file `chars.txt` contains **64 bytes** of data.
    - The stream is set up with `highWaterMark: 4`, meaning it will attempt to load 4 bytes into the internal buffer at a time.

2. **First `readable` Event**:
    - The first time the `readable` event is emitted, the internal buffer will contain **4 bytes** from the file (since `highWaterMark: 4`).
    - **`readableLength`**: Initially, the internal buffer has 4 bytes of data, so `readStream.readableLength` will return **4**.
    - **`read(1)`**: When you call `read(1)`, you are telling the stream to read 1 byte from the internal buffer. So, the first byte will be read, and it will log that byte (in the form of a Buffer object).
    - **After `read(1)`**: Since you read 1 byte, the buffer now contains **3 bytes**. Therefore, the next time you call `readableLength`, it will return **3**.

3. **Subsequent `readable` Events**:
    - After consuming the data from the buffer, the stream will attempt to refill the internal buffer with the next 4 bytes from the file (since `highWaterMark` is set to 4).
    - Each time the `readable` event is triggered again, the buffer will contain 4 bytes of new data, and the sequence of reading and logging continues in the same pattern.

    Here’s how this works:

    - **After reading 1 byte** from the first chunk (buffer size 4), the buffer now contains 3 bytes.
    - The internal buffer will refill with the next 4 bytes, so now the buffer contains 4 bytes again.
    - This process repeats for each 4-byte chunk in the file.

### Expected Output (Step-by-Step):

Given that `chars.txt` has 64 bytes, and you're reading 1 byte at a time:

1. **First readable event**:
    - `readableLength = 4` (the buffer size is initially 4 bytes).
    - `read(1)` reads 1 byte, so `readableLength` becomes **3** (3 bytes left in the buffer).
   
    Output:
    ```
    4
    <Buffer containing the first byte>
    3
    ```

2. **Second readable event**:
    - The stream refills the buffer with the next 4 bytes from the file.
    - `readableLength = 4` (the buffer now contains 4 bytes again).
    - `read(1)` reads 1 byte, leaving **3 bytes** in the buffer.
   
    Output:
    ```
    4
    <Buffer containing the second byte>
    3
    ```

3. **Subsequent readable events**:
    - This process continues with the internal buffer refilling after every `read(1)` call, and the `readableLength` being logged after each read.
    - The internal buffer keeps containing 4 bytes after every refill (unless you read all 4 bytes), and you keep consuming 1 byte at a time.
   
    The pattern of output will repeat, logging `4` when the buffer is full, the byte being read, and then `3` as the remaining data in the buffer after each `read(1)`.

    This will continue until the entire 64 bytes are read.

### Final Output:
The sequence of outputs will look like this:

```
4
<Buffer containing the first byte>
3
4
<Buffer containing the second byte>
3
4
<Buffer containing the third byte>
3
...
4
<Buffer containing the last byte>
0
```

Once all the data is read, the stream will eventually emit an `'end'` event, indicating that the reading process is complete.

### Why Does This Happen?
- **`highWaterMark: 4`**: The buffer size is set to 4 bytes. The stream fetches 4 bytes at a time from the file and puts them in its internal buffer.
- **`read(1)`**: You are reading only 1 byte from the buffer at a time. This means after each read, the internal buffer will have 3 bytes remaining (since it was originally filled with 4 bytes).
- **Refilling**: After each read, if the buffer is not full, the stream will fetch the next 4 bytes from the file to refill the buffer. This repeats until all 64 bytes are consumed.
