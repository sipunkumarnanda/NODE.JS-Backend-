## **📌 `readStream._____` → All Properties & Methods of Readable Streams in Node.js**

In Node.js, a **Readable Stream** (`fs.createReadStream()`) provides several properties and methods that help in reading data efficiently. Below is a **detailed breakdown** of all the important **properties** and **methods** of `readStream`.

---

# 🔹 **1. Properties of `readStream`**
These properties provide information about the stream's state.

### **1️⃣ `readStream.readable`**
- **Description**: Indicates whether the stream is still readable (i.e., not ended or destroyed).
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **`true`** → If the stream is open and can be read.
- **`false`** → If the stream has been closed or ended.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("file.txt");

console.log(readStream.readable); // true (if stream is open)
```

---

### **2️⃣ `readStream.readableHighWaterMark`**
- **Description**: The `highWaterMark` value that was set when creating the stream.
- **Type**: `number` (bytes)
- **Purpose**: Defines the internal buffer size (default: `64 KB` for file streams).
- **Note**: This is **read-only** and does **not** change dynamically.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("file.txt", { highWaterMark: 4 });
console.log(readStream.readableHighWaterMark); // 4
```

---

### **3️⃣ `readStream.readableLength`**
- **Description**: The number of bytes currently stored in the internal buffer.
- **Type**: `number` (bytes)
- **Usage**: Helps monitor how much data is buffered.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
readStream.on("readable", () => {
    console.log(readStream.readableLength); // Number of bytes in buffer
});
```

---

### **4️⃣ `readStream.readableFlowing`**
- **Description**: Indicates whether the stream is in **flowing mode** or **paused mode**.
- **Type**: `boolean | null`
  - `true` → Flowing mode (data is being automatically read).
  - `false` → Paused mode (data must be read manually).
  - `null` → Initial state (before any event listener is attached).

#### **Example:**
```javascript
console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // null (before adding any event listener)

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // true (since it's now flowing)
});
```

---

### **5️⃣ `readStream.readableEnded`**
- **Description**: Becomes `true` when the stream has completely read all data.
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Purpose**: Helps track whether the stream has finished reading.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log(readStream.readableEnded); // true (stream has ended)
});
```

---

### **6️⃣ `readStream.readableObjectMode`**
- **Description**: Indicates whether the stream is in **object mode** (i.e., reading non-buffer data).
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Default**: `false` (for file streams, which read `Buffer` data).

---

# 🔹 **2. Methods of `readStream`**
These methods control the behavior of the readable stream.

---

### **1️⃣ `readStream.read(size)`**
- **Description**: Reads **up to `size` bytes** from the internal buffer.
- **When to use?** In **paused mode** (when using `"readable"` event).
- **Returns**: A `Buffer` (or `null` if no data is available).
- **If `size` is greater than available bytes**, it returns all available bytes.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
readStream.on("readable", () => {
    let chunk;
    while ((chunk = readStream.read(4)) !== null) {
        console.log("Read chunk:", chunk.toString());
    }
});
```

---

### **2️⃣ `readStream.pause()`**
- **Description**: Pauses the stream (switches from flowing mode to paused mode).
- **When to use?** If you want to manually control when data is read.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received chunk:", chunk.toString());
    readStream.pause(); // Stop reading
});
```

---

### **3️⃣ `readStream.resume()`**
- **Description**: Resumes the stream (switches back to flowing mode).
- **When to use?** If the stream was paused using `.pause()`.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    readStream.resume();
}, 2000); // Resume reading after 2 seconds
```

---

### **4️⃣ `readStream.destroy([error])`**
- **Description**: Destroys the stream and releases resources.
- **When to use?** If an error occurs or if you no longer need the stream.
- **Optional `error` parameter**: If provided, it emits an `"error"` event.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
readStream.destroy(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```

---

### **5️⃣ `readStream.unshift(chunk)`**
- **Description**: Pushes data back into the internal buffer.
- **Use case**: When you have read some data but decide to put it back.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
readStream.on("readable", () => {
    let chunk = readStream.read(4);
    console.log("Read chunk:", chunk.toString());

    readStream.unshift(chunk); // Push data back
});
```

# 🔹 **3. Events in `readStream`**
These events notify when different actions happen.

| **Event**      | **Description** | **When it Occurs?** |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| `"data"`       | Emits a chunk of data in flowing mode | Automatically when data is available |
| `"readable"`   | Indicates that data is available in the buffer | When the internal buffer has data |
| `"end"`        | Signals that the stream has finished reading | When no more data is left |
| `"close"`      | Fires when the stream is closed | After reading is complete |
| `"error"`      | Fires when an error occurs | On file read failure, permission errors, etc. |

---

# 🔹 **4. Summary Table**
| Property/Method | Description | Use Case |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| `.readable` | Indicates if the stream is still open | Checking if reading is possible |
| `.readableHighWaterMark` | Buffer size set when stream was created | Monitoring stream settings |
| `.readableLength` | Amount of data in internal buffer | Managing data consumption |
| `.readableFlowing` | `true` for flowing mode, `false` for paused | Checking stream state |
| `.readableEnded` | `true` when stream ends | Detecting stream completion |
| `.read(size)` | Reads a specific number of bytes from buffer | Manual reading (paused mode) |
| `.pause()` | Pauses stream from emitting `"data"` events | Temporarily stopping reading |
| `.resume()` | Resumes stream in flowing mode | Restarting a paused stream |
| `.destroy([error])` | Destroys the stream | Freeing resources |
| `.unshift(chunk)` | Puts data back into the internal buffer | Handling unwanted reads |

---

## **🔹 Conclusion**
- Use **flowing mode** (`"data"` event) for **automatic reading**.
- Use **paused mode** (`"readable"` event + `.read()`) for **manual control**.
- Use `.pause()` and `.resume()` for **controlling reading speed**.
- Use `.destroy()` to **release resources** when a stream is no longer needed.
