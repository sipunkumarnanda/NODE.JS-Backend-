## **📌 What is Internal Buffer in Readable Streams?**  

### **1️⃣ Understanding the Internal Buffer**  
In Node.js, **Readable Streams** have an **internal buffer** that temporarily stores chunks of data before they are consumed. This buffer acts as a queue where data is held until it is read by the user or a consumer.

### **2️⃣ How the Internal Buffer Works**
- When data is read from a source (like a file or network), it is first stored in the internal buffer.
- The stream attempts to provide data from the buffer when a consumer requests it.
- If the buffer is empty, the stream will wait until more data arrives.
- If the buffer reaches a certain size (determined by `highWaterMark`), the stream will **pause reading** from the source to prevent memory overload.

### **3️⃣ Example of Internal Buffer in Readable Streams**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

// Creating a Readable Stream with a highWaterMark of 10 bytes
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("data.txt", { highWaterMark: 10 });

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received Chunk:", chunk.toString());
});
```
#### **🔹 What Happens Here?**
1. **Data is Read in Chunks**: The `highWaterMark: 10` tells Node.js to read **10 bytes at a time** and store it in the internal buffer.
2. **Buffered Data is Provided to Consumers**: The buffer stores data temporarily until it is read using `.on("data")`.
3. **Buffer is Refilled if Needed**: Once the buffer empties, the stream fetches more data from the source.

### **4️⃣ Checking Internal Buffer Size**
The **internal buffer size** can be checked using the `.readableLength` property:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("data.txt", { highWaterMark: 10 });

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Chunk Received:", chunk.toString());
    console.log("Buffer Size:", readStream.readableLength);
});
```
#### **🔹 Output Example:**
```
Chunk Received: Hello Worl
Buffer Size: 0
Chunk Received: d! This is
Buffer Size: 0
```
- `readableLength` shows how many bytes are **currently stored in the internal buffer**.
- The buffer size will usually be **0** after a chunk is fully read.

### **5️⃣ Why is Internal Buffer Important?**
✔ **Improves Performance** – The buffer allows streams to handle data efficiently by **reading in chunks** instead of waiting for an entire file to load.  
✔ **Prevents Memory Overload** – The buffer size prevents excessive memory consumption, especially for large files.  
✔ **Controls Data Flow** – The buffer works with `pause()` and `resume()` to regulate data flow.

### **6️⃣ Summary**
| **Feature**            | **Description**  |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Internal Buffer**    | Temporary storage where unread data is kept. |
| **readableLength**     | Shows the amount of data in the buffer. |
| **highWaterMark**      | Defines the max buffer size before stopping reads. |
| **Data Flow Control**  | The stream pauses if the buffer is full and resumes when space is available. |

✅ **Conclusion**: The **internal buffer** is a crucial part of how Readable Streams work, ensuring efficient data handling without memory overload! 🚀

Yes, the **internal buffer size** of a **Readable Stream** depends on the `highWaterMark` value.  

### **How `highWaterMark` Affects Internal Buffer Size?**  
- The `highWaterMark` property **defines the size of the internal buffer** in bytes (for binary streams) or in characters (for text streams).  
- When you create a **Readable Stream**, the internal buffer **stores data up to the highWaterMark limit** before being processed.  
- If data is read **slower** than it arrives, the buffer fills up and the stream may pause automatically.  
- If data is read **faster**, the buffer may be partially empty most of the time.

---

### **Example: How `highWaterMark` Affects Buffering**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

// Creating a Readable Stream with a buffer size of 8 bytes
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", { highWaterMark: 8 });

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes:`, chunk.toString());
});
```
#### **Behavior:**
- If `example.txt` has **32 bytes of data**, the stream will emit **4 chunks of 8 bytes** each.
- If the `highWaterMark` is **16 bytes**, the stream will emit **2 chunks of 16 bytes**.
- If `highWaterMark` is **default** (64 KB for files), it will read **larger chunks at once**.

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ The **internal buffer size** is directly controlled by `highWaterMark`.  
✅ A **larger `highWaterMark`** leads to **fewer reads but larger chunks**.  
✅ A **smaller `highWaterMark`** results in **more frequent reads with smaller chunks**.  
✅ It is **not fixed** and changes dynamically as the stream processes data.
