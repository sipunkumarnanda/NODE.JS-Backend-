### **`data` Event vs `readable` Event in Readable Streams**  

In Node.js, `Readable Streams` provide two primary ways to consume data:  
1. **The `data` event** (Flowing Mode)  
2. **The `readable` event** (Paused Mode)  

Both these events serve different purposes and behave differently based on how the stream is being read. Let’s explore the differences, use cases, and when to use which.

## **1️⃣ `data` Event (Flowing Mode)**
### **🔹 Description:**  
- The `data` event is emitted whenever a chunk of data is available in the stream.  
- It works in **flowing mode**, meaning data is automatically read and passed to the event listener.  
- The stream continuously emits `data` events until the entire file is read.  

### **🔹 How It Works:**  
- When you listen for the `data` event, the stream automatically starts flowing.  
- The chunks of data are received as a `Buffer` object (unless encoding is specified).  
- You don’t have to manually call `read()`, as data is pushed automatically.  

### **🔹 Example:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", { highWaterMark: 8 });

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received Chunk:", chunk.toString());
});
```

### **🔹 Output Example:**
```
Received Chunk: Hello, t
Received Chunk: his is a
Received Chunk:  test fil
Received Chunk: e.
```

### **🔹 When to Use `data` Event?**
✔ When you want **fast, continuous data processing**.  
✔ When you don’t need precise control over when data is read.  
✔ Suitable for real-time applications like **video/audio streaming, logs processing, and network communication**.  

### **🔹 Key Points:**
✅ **Automatic Data Flow** → Stream automatically reads data.  
✅ **No Need to Call `.read()`** → Data is pushed automatically.  
✅ **No Fine Control** → You can't pause/resume reading selectively (only using `.pause()` and `.resume()`).

## **2️⃣ `readable` Event (Paused Mode)**
### **🔹 Description:**  
- The `readable` event is emitted when a new chunk is **available in the internal buffer**, but it is **not automatically read**.  
- It works in **paused mode**, meaning you must manually call `.read()` to consume data.  
- Gives you fine-grained control over how and when data is read.  

### **🔹 How It Works:**  
- The stream fills the internal buffer with data and emits the `readable` event when there’s data available.  
- You must explicitly call `readStream.read(size)` to consume the data.  
- If there is no more data available, `.read()` returns `null`, and the `readable` event will be emitted again when new data is ready.  

### **🔹 Example:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", { highWaterMark: 8 });

readStream.on("readable", () => {
    let chunk;
    while ((chunk = readStream.read()) !== null) {
        console.log("Read Chunk:", chunk.toString());
    }
});
```

### **🔹 Output Example:**
```
Read Chunk: Hello, t
Read Chunk: his is a
Read Chunk:  test fil
Read Chunk: e.
```

### **🔹 When to Use `readable` Event?**
✔ When you need **fine control** over when and how much data is read.  
✔ When you want to process data at your own pace (e.g., handling backpressure).  
✔ Useful when implementing **custom parsing, handling structured data like JSON, or processing large files in a controlled manner**.  

### **🔹 Key Points:**
✅ **Manual Reading** → You must call `.read(size)` to consume data.  
✅ **More Control** → Allows pausing, resuming, and controlling how much data is read at a time.  
✅ **Handles Backpressure** → Prevents overwhelming the system when processing large files.

## **3️⃣ Key Differences: `data` vs `readable`**
| Feature            | `data` Event (Flowing Mode) | `readable` Event (Paused Mode) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Mode**          | Flowing                 | Paused                      |
| **Data Handling** | Automatic               | Manual (`.read()` required) |
| **Consumption**   | Stream pushes data      | You pull data manually      |
| **Backpressure**  | Hard to handle          | Easy to handle              |
| **Use Case**      | Fast processing, live streaming | Controlled reading, structured data |

## **4️⃣ When to Use What?**
| **Scenario** | **Use `data` Event** | **Use `readable` Event** |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Real-time data processing (e.g., logs, streaming audio/video)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Processing large files without loading them into memory all at once** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Custom parsing of structured data (e.g., JSON, CSV processing)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Need for fine control over data flow** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Simple file reading without backpressure concerns** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

## **5️⃣ Summary: Which One Should You Use?**
- **Use the `data` event** when you want the fastest and simplest way to process data.  
- **Use the `readable` event** when you need fine control over reading and processing, especially with large files or structured data.
