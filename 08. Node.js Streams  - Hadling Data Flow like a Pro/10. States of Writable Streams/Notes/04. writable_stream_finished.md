### **Understanding `writableFinished` in Writable Streams**  

When working with Node.js writable streams, `writableFinished` is an important property that **does not immediately become `true` when `writeStream.end()` is called**.  

Instead, it remains `false` until **all buffered data has been written to the destination and the stream is completely finished**.  

---

### **Why is `writableFinished` `false` After `writeStream.end()`?**  

#### **1️⃣ `writeStream.end()` Signals the End but Doesn't Immediately Finish Writing**
- `writeStream.end()` **only signals** that no more data will be written to the stream.
- However, there might still be **data in the buffer** that needs to be flushed to the destination.
- Because of this, `writableFinished` remains `false` until **all writes are completely finished**.

#### **2️⃣ `writableEnded` and `writableFinished` Are Different**
| Property | Meaning | When Does It Become `true`? |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------|
| `writableEnded` | `end()` was called | Immediately after calling `end()` |
| `writableFinished` | All data has been written and flushed | After the stream is fully done writing |

### **Example Demonstrating `writableFinished`**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writeStream.write('Hello, ');
writeStream.write('World!');

writeStream.end(); // Ends the stream
console.log(writeStream.writableEnded);   // true (Immediately)
console.log(writeStream.writableFinished); // false (Still writing to disk)

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(writeStream.writableFinished); // true (Now it's fully finished)
}, 1000);
```

**Expected Output:**
```
true
false
true (after timeout)
```

### **When Does `writableFinished` Become `true`?**
1. **All pending writes are flushed** from the internal buffer.  
2. **The underlying file or network resource** is completely written and closed.  
3. The `"finish"` event is emitted:  
   ```javascript
   writeStream.on('finish', () => {
       console.log('Stream writing is fully finished.');
   });
   ```
4. If an **error** occurs, `writableFinished` might not become `true` (use `writeStream.on('error', callback)` to handle errors).

### **Key Takeaways**
- `writeStream.end()` **only marks the end of writing**, it does not mean all data is written.  
- `writableEnded` becomes `true` **immediately** after `end()` is called.  
- `writableFinished` remains `false` **until all data is completely flushed** to disk.  
- Use the `"finish"` event to reliably detect when writing is fully done.
