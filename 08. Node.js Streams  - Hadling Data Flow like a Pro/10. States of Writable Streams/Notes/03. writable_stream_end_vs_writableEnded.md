### **Understanding `writeStream.end()` and `writeStream.writableEnded` in Writable Streams**  

In Node.js writable streams, the `end()` method is used to **signal the end of writing operations**. Once this method is called, the stream enters a special state where no more writes can be performed.  

The property `writableEnded` helps track whether `end()` has been **called**, but it does not necessarily mean that all data has been written to the destination yet.  

---

### **Why Does `writeStream.writableEnded` Become `true` Immediately After `end()`?**  

#### **1️⃣ `end()` Marks the End of Writing**
- When `writeStream.end()` is called, it **immediately sets `writableEnded = true`**.
- This means the stream **knows** that no more `write()` calls should happen.
- However, the actual process of flushing remaining data to disk might still be ongoing.

#### **2️⃣ `writableEnded` Only Tracks the `end()` Call**
- `writableEnded` becomes `true` **as soon as** `end()` is invoked, even before all data is physically written to the destination.
- This property only confirms that "writing has been finished logically," not necessarily completed in storage.

### **Example Demonstrating `writableEnded`**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writeStream.write('Hello, ');
writeStream.write('World!');

console.log(writeStream.writableEnded); // false => Still writable

writeStream.end(); // Signals the end of writing

console.log(writeStream.writableEnded); // true => `end()` was called
```

**Output:**
```
false
true
```

### **Difference Between `writableEnded` and `writableFinished`**
| Property | Meaning | When Does It Become `true`? |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------|
| `writableEnded` | Has `end()` been called? | Immediately after `end()` is called |
| `writableFinished` | Has all data been written and flushed? | When the stream fully finishes writing |

#### **Example: `writableEnded` vs `writableFinished`**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writeStream.write('Node.js Streams');

writeStream.end(); // Ends the stream
console.log(writeStream.writableEnded); // true (Immediately)

console.log(writeStream.writableFinished); // false (Still writing to disk)

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(writeStream.writableFinished); // true (After writing completes)
}, 1000);
```

**Expected Output:**
```
true
false
true  (after timeout)
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. `writeStream.end()` **immediately** sets `writableEnded = true`, meaning no more writes are allowed.
2. **Data might still be flushing** to disk, so `writableFinished` might still be `false` for a short time.
3. Use the `"finish"` event instead of checking `writableFinished` manually if you need to execute something after the stream is completely done.

```javascript
writeStream.on('finish', () => {
    console.log('All data has been written and the stream is fully closed.');
});
```
