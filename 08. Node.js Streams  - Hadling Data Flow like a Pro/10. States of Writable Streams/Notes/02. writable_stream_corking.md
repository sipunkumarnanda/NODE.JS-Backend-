### **Understanding `writeStream.cork()` in Writable Streams**  

When you call `writeStream.cork()`, it **buffers** the data written to the stream but does **not** immediately flush it to the destination (e.g., a file or network socket). This means the data stays in the **internal buffer** of the stream until either:  

1. **`writeStream.uncork()` is called** â€“ This flushes all buffered data at once.  
2. **The internal buffer reaches the `highWaterMark` limit** â€“ The stream may automatically flush if too much data accumulates.  
3. **`writeStream.end()` is called** â€“ If the stream is ended, all buffered writes are flushed.  

### **How `cork()` Works**  
- Normally, when you call `writeStream.write()`, Node.js attempts to write the data **immediately** to disk or another destination.  
- When you call `cork()`, writes are **collected** in memory (buffered) instead of being written instantly.  
- This helps in **batching writes** together, reducing multiple I/O operations and improving efficiency.  
- You must call `uncork()` to **flush** the buffered writes manually.

### **Example: `cork()` vs Without `cork()`**
#### **Without `cork()` (Each write is processed separately)**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writeStream.write('A'); // Written immediately
writeStream.write('B'); // Written immediately
writeStream.write('C'); // Written immediately
writeStream.end(); // Ends stream
```
âœ… **Each write happens separately**, leading to multiple disk I/O operations.

---

#### **With `cork()` (Batching writes together)**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writeStream.cork();  // Buffer the writes

writeStream.write('A');
writeStream.write('B');
writeStream.write('C');

console.log(writeStream.writableCorked); // 1 => Data is still in buffer

writeStream.uncork();  // Now, all data is flushed to disk at once

console.log(writeStream.writableCorked); // 0 => No more buffered writes

writeStream.end(); // Ends stream
```
âœ… **All writes happen in one operation**, reducing unnecessary disk I/O.

### **Why Use `cork()`?**
1. **Performance Optimization** â€“ Instead of writing each chunk separately, `cork()` collects multiple writes and flushes them in bulk, reducing disk I/O overhead.
2. **Efficient Batch Processing** â€“ When writing small pieces of data, it prevents unnecessary operations, especially useful in logging or streaming.
3. **Controlled Buffering** â€“ Ensures that data stays in memory until explicitly flushed, allowing better control over write behavior.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- `cork()` **buffers** write operations instead of writing them immediately.  
- Data **stays in memory** (internal buffer) until `uncork()` is called or the stream is ended.  
- Improves efficiency by **reducing multiple I/O operations** into a single batch.  
- Always call `uncork()` to **flush** buffered writes when ready.
