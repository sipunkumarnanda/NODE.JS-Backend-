# **States of Writable Streams in Node.js**  

Writable streams in Node.js allow data to be written to a destination in a controlled and efficient manner. Understanding the different states of writable streams is crucial for handling data correctly. Below are the key properties and methods related to the states of writable streams:

---

## **1. `writeStream.writable` (Is the Stream Writable?)**
### **Definition:**  
The `writable` property determines whether the stream is currently available for writing. If it is `true`, data can still be written. If it is `false`, no more data can be written.

### **Behavior:**
- The stream is **writable (`true`)** when created.
- After calling `writeStream.end()`, it becomes **false**.
- If the stream encounters an error or is destroyed, it becomes **false**.

### **Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("file.txt");

console.log(writeStream.writable);  // true => Stream is writable

writeStream.write("Hello, "); // Writing data to the stream
console.log(writeStream.writable);  // true => Still writable

writeStream.end(); // Ends the stream
console.log(writeStream.writable);  // false => Stream is no longer writable
```

### **Key Takeaways:**
- Before writing data, check if `writeStream.writable` is `true` to prevent errors.
- Calling `end()` makes `writable` **false**.
- If an error occurs or the stream is closed, `writable` becomes **false**.

## **2. `writableCorked` & `writeStream.cork()` (Buffering Data)**
### **Definition:**  
The `writableCorked` property represents how many write operations are currently buffered because of `cork()`. The `cork()` method delays flushing writes, allowing multiple writes to be grouped and executed efficiently.

### **Why Use `cork()`?**
- Prevents multiple small writes from being written to disk immediately.
- Improves performance by reducing I/O operations.
- Works best when writing multiple chunks of data at once.

### **Behavior:**
- When `cork()` is called, writes are buffered and not immediately written.
- The `writableCorked` value increases when data is written inside a `cork()` block.
- Calling `uncork()` flushes all buffered data and resets `writableCorked` to `0`.

### **Example:**
```javascript
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("file.txt", { highWaterMark: 4 });

writeStream.cork();  // Start buffering writes

writeStream.write("A");
writeStream.write("B");
writeStream.write("C");
writeStream.write("D");
writeStream.write("E");

console.log(writeStream.writableCorked); // 1 => Buffered writes exist

writeStream.uncork(); // Flush buffered writes

console.log(writeStream.writableCorked); // 0 => No more buffered writes
```

### **Key Takeaways:**
- `cork()` buffers write operations to improve performance.
- `uncork()` flushes all buffered writes at once.
- `writableCorked` shows how many writes are still buffered.

## **3. `writeStream.end()` & `writableEnded` (Closing the Stream)**
### **Definition:**  
The `end()` method signals that no more data will be written to the stream.  
The `writableEnded` property indicates whether `end()` has been called.

### **Behavior:**
- Calling `end()` means **no more writes** can happen.
- `writableEnded` becomes **true** immediately after calling `end()`, but data might still be in the process of writing.

### **Example:**
```javascript
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("file.txt");

writeStream.write("Hello, ");
writeStream.write("World!");

console.log(writeStream.writableEnded); // false => Stream is still open

writeStream.end(); // No more writes allowed

console.log(writeStream.writableEnded); // true => end() was called
```

### **Key Takeaways:**
- `writableEnded` turns `true` **immediately** after calling `end()`.
- Data might still be flushing after `end()` is called.

---

## **4. `writableFinished` (Has the Stream Fully Ended?)**
### **Definition:**  
The `writableFinished` property determines whether all the data has been successfully written to the destination.

### **Difference Between `writableEnded` and `writableFinished`:**
| Property | Becomes `true` when |
|----------|---------------------|
| `writableEnded` | `end()` is called (but data may still be writing) |
| `writableFinished` | Data is completely flushed and the stream is fully closed |

### **Behavior:**
- `writableFinished` is **false** immediately after calling `end()`, because the final data might still be writing.
- It becomes **true** once all data has been written and the stream is fully closed.

### **Example:**
```javascript
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("file.txt");

writeStream.write("Some data");

writeStream.end(); // Closes the stream
console.log(writeStream.writableFinished); // false => Data might still be writing

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(writeStream.writableFinished); // true => Data is fully written
}, 1000);
```

### **Key Takeaways:**
- `writableFinished` confirms **everything** has been written to disk.
- It becomes `true` later than `writableEnded`.

## **Summary of Writable Stream States**

| Property | Purpose | Becomes `true` when |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| `writable` | Can data still be written? | Becomes `false` when `end()` is called |
| `writableCorked` | How many writes are buffered? | Increases with `cork()`, resets with `uncork()` |
| `writableEnded` | Has `end()` been called? | Becomes `true` immediately after `end()` |
| `writableFinished` | Has all data been written? | Becomes `true` when the stream is fully closed |

### **Best Practices:**
âœ… Always check `writable` before writing to a stream.  
âœ… Use `cork()` for batch writes to improve performance.  
âœ… Handle `"finish"` or `"error"` events to ensure data integrity.  
âœ… If waiting for the stream to finish, listen for the `"finish"` event instead of checking `writableFinished` manually.
