# **What is a Stream?** 🌊💻  

A **stream** in Node.js is a continuous flow of data that can be read or written in chunks instead of loading everything into memory at once. Streams are useful for handling large amounts of data efficiently.  

🔹 **Why Use Streams?**  
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Streams process data in chunks rather than loading it all at once.  
- **Faster Processing**: Data can be processed while being read or written.  
- **Handles Large Files**: Streams are ideal for working with big files, such as videos, logs, or real-time data.

# **Types of Streams in Node.js** 🚀  

Node.js provides **four types of streams**:  

## **1️⃣ Readable Streams** 📖  
These streams allow reading data in chunks from a source. You can consume data but not write to them.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Reading a file using `fs.createReadStream()`.  
- Receiving HTTP requests.  

🔹 **Example Code:**  
```js
const fs = require('fs');

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt', 'utf8');

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
});
```

## **2️⃣ Writable Streams** ✍️  
These streams allow writing data in chunks to a destination. You can write to them but not read from them.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Writing data to a file using `fs.createWriteStream()`.  
- Sending data in an HTTP response.  

🔹 **Example Code:**  
```js
const fs = require('fs');

const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writableStream.write('Hello, this is a writable stream!');
writableStream.end();
```

## **3️⃣ Duplex Streams** 🔄  
Duplex streams allow both **reading** and **writing** data. They are useful for bidirectional communication.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- **TCP sockets** (`net.Socket`).  
- **WebSockets** (real-time communication).  

🔹 **Example Code:**  
```js
const { Duplex } = require('stream');

const duplexStream = new Duplex({
    read(size) {
        this.push('Data from Read side');
        this.push(null);
    },
    write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
        console.log('Written:', chunk.toString());
        callback();
    }
});

duplexStream.on('data', (chunk) => console.log('Read:', chunk.toString()));
duplexStream.write('Hello from Write side');
duplexStream.end();
```

---

## **4️⃣ Transform Streams** 🔁  
Transform streams are a special type of **duplex stream** that can **modify** data as it is being read or written.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- **Compression** (`zlib.createGzip()` for Gzip compression).  
- **Encryption** (`crypto.createCipher()` for encrypting data).  

🔹 **Example Code (Converting text to uppercase)**  
```js
const { Transform } = require('stream');

const transformStream = new Transform({
    transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
        this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
        callback();
    }
});

transformStream.write('hello');
transformStream.write(' world');
transformStream.end();

transformStream.on('data', (chunk) => console.log(chunk.toString()));
```

# **Conclusion** ✅  
- **Streams are efficient for handling large files and real-time data processing.**  
- **Use Readable Streams** when you need to read data in chunks (e.g., file reading).  
- **Use Writable Streams** when you need to write data in chunks (e.g., file writing).  
- **Use Duplex Streams** when you need both reading & writing (e.g., sockets).  
- **Use Transform Streams** when you need to modify data while streaming (e.g., compression).  

🔹 **Streams help optimize memory and speed up data processing in Node.js!** 🚀
