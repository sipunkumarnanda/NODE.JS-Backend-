## **Understanding `highWaterMark`, `writableHighWaterMark`, and `writableLength` in Writable Streams**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `highWaterMark` in `fs.createWriteStream`**
When creating a writable stream using `fs.createWriteStream()`, the `highWaterMark` option determines the internal buffer size limit for the writable stream.

#### **Syntax:**
```js
const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt', { highWaterMark: 4 }); // 4 bytes buffer size
```

#### **What it does?**
- `highWaterMark` sets the size of the internal buffer for the writable stream.
- When you write data to the stream, it first goes into this internal buffer before being flushed to the file.
- If you write more data than the `highWaterMark`, it **does not immediately reject** but indicates that the buffer is full.

#### **Default Value:**
- If `highWaterMark` is **not specified**, the default size is **16 KB (16,384 bytes)**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `writableHighWaterMark`**
The `writableHighWaterMark` is a **read-only** property of a writable stream that returns the `highWaterMark` value set when creating the stream.

#### **Example:**
```js
console.log(writeStream.writableHighWaterMark); // Output: 4 (as set in highWaterMark)
```

#### **Key Points:**
- It represents the **buffer size limit** set for the writable stream.
- Unlike `highWaterMark`, this is a **read-only** property and cannot be modified after stream creation.
- It helps developers check the configured buffer size for the stream.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ `writableLength`**
The `writableLength` property tells us **how much data is currently stored** in the internal buffer of the writable stream.

#### **Example:**
```js
writeStream.write('AB'); // Writes 2 bytes
console.log(writeStream.writableLength); // Output: 2

writeStream.write('CD'); // Writes 2 more bytes
console.log(writeStream.writableLength); // Output: 4
```

#### **Key Points:**
- It dynamically updates as data is written and flushed.
- If `writableLength` **equals `writableHighWaterMark`**, the buffer is full, and additional writes may cause **backpressure**.
- Once the buffer is emptied, `writableLength` drops back to `0`.

### **Example Demonstrating All Three Concepts**
```js
const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt', { highWaterMark: 4 });

console.log("writableHighWaterMark:", writeStream.writableHighWaterMark); // Output: 4

writeStream.write('AB'); // Writes 2 bytes
console.log("writableLength after 1st write:", writeStream.writableLength); // Output: 2

writeStream.write('CD'); // Writes 2 more bytes
console.log("writableLength after 2nd write:", writeStream.writableLength); // Output: 4 (buffer is full)

writeStream.write('EF'); // Writes 2 more bytes (causes backpressure)
console.log("writableLength after 3rd write:", writeStream.writableLength); // Output: 6 (buffer exceeded highWaterMark)
```

### **üîπ Summary**
| Property | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `highWaterMark` | The buffer limit set when creating a writable stream (default: 16 KB). |
| `writableHighWaterMark` | Read-only property that returns the `highWaterMark` value. |
| `writableLength` | Current amount of data stored in the internal buffer. |
