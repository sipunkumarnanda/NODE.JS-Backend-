## **Back Pressure and Internal Buffer of Writable & Readable Streams in Node.js**  

### **1. Understanding Internal Buffers in Streams**  
Both **Readable** and **Writable** streams in Node.js have internal buffers that manage the flow of data efficiently. The key difference lies in how these buffers operate for each type of stream.  

---

### **2. Internal Buffer in Readable Streams**  
The internal buffer in a **Readable Stream** temporarily stores data that has been read from a source (like a file) but has not yet been consumed by a user or passed to a writable stream.  

#### **Key Properties of Readable Stream Buffer:**  
- **`highWaterMark`**: Defines the maximum buffer size in bytes before the stream stops reading more data.  
- **`readableLength`**: Represents how much data is currently in the buffer, waiting to be consumed.  

#### **Example: Readable Stream Internal Buffer**  
```js
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt', { highWaterMark: 4 }); // Buffer size set to 4 bytes

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data:`, chunk.toString());
});
```
ðŸ”¹ **Explanation:**  
- The stream reads `4 bytes` at a time into its internal buffer.  
- The `data` event is triggered only when data is available in the buffer.  
- If the consumer is slow, the internal buffer will fill up, causing **backpressure.**

### **3. Internal Buffer in Writable Streams**  
A **Writable Stream's** internal buffer holds data that has been written to it but not yet flushed to the destination (e.g., a file or network).  

#### **Key Properties of Writable Stream Buffer:**  
- **`highWaterMark`**: Defines the maximum buffer size before the stream signals that writes should slow down.  
- **`writableLength`**: Represents the amount of data currently in the buffer, waiting to be flushed.  
- **`writableNeedDrain`**: Becomes `true` when the internal buffer is full, indicating that the write should pause until drained.  

#### **Example: Writable Stream Internal Buffer**  
```js
import fs from 'fs';

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt', { highWaterMark: 4 });

let canWrite = writeStream.write('Hello'); // Writing 5 bytes (exceeds 4-byte buffer)

console.log(`Can Write More Data? ${canWrite}`); // Logs: false, as buffer is full

writeStream.on('drain', () => {
    console.log("Buffer drained. Now, we can write more data.");
});
```
ðŸ”¹ **Explanation:**  
- The first `write()` call exceeds the `4-byte` buffer limit.  
- Since the buffer is full, `write()` returns `false`, signaling **backpressure.**  
- The `drain` event fires when the buffer empties, allowing more data to be written.

### **4. What is Back Pressure?**  
Backpressure occurs when the **Writable Stream** cannot process incoming data as fast as the **Readable Stream** provides it, causing the internal buffer to fill up.  

#### **Example of Back Pressure Handling**
```js
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('largeFile.txt', { highWaterMark: 4 });
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt', { highWaterMark: 4 });

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    if (!writeStream.write(chunk)) {
        readStream.pause();  // Pause reading if write buffer is full
    }
});

writeStream.on('drain', () => {
    readStream.resume();  // Resume reading when write buffer is empty
});
```
ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
1. The `readStream` reads data into its internal buffer.  
2. The `writeStream` writes to its buffer, but if full, `write()` returns `false`.  
3. `readStream.pause()` prevents overflow when the writable stream is not ready.  
4. When the buffer is empty, the `drain` event fires, and we `resume()` reading.

### **5. Difference Between Readable and Writable Internal Buffers**  

| Feature              | Readable Stream Buffer                            | Writable Stream Buffer                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Stores incoming data until consumed             | Holds data before flushing to destination      |
| **Controlled By**    | `highWaterMark`, `readableLength`                | `highWaterMark`, `writableLength`              |
| **When Does It Fill?** | If data is read faster than consumed          | If writes happen faster than the drain process |
| **Solution**         | Use `pause()` and `resume()`                     | Use `drain` event to manage backpressure      |

### **6. Summary**
- **Readable Streams** store data in their internal buffer until it's consumed.  
- **Writable Streams** hold data until it's written to the destination.  
- **Backpressure** happens when the writable stream is slower than the readable stream.  
- **Handling Backpressure** involves `pause()`, `resume()`, and listening to `drain`.
