### **Understanding the Boolean Return Value of `writeStream.write()` in Node.js**

In Node.js, the `writeStream.write(chunk)` method returns a **boolean** value. This return value indicates whether the internal buffer of the writable stream is full or if more data can be written immediately.

---

### **📌 Return Values of `writeStream.write(chunk)`**
- **`true`** → The data was **written successfully** to the internal buffer, and you can continue writing more data immediately.
- **`false`** → The internal buffer **is full**, meaning you should **pause writing** and wait for the `drain` event before writing more data.

### **🔹 How `writeStream.write(chunk)` Works Internally**
1. When you call `writeStream.write(chunk)`, Node.js attempts to write the data into an internal buffer.
2. If the internal buffer **has space** (i.e., `writableLength < writableHighWaterMark`), it **returns `true`**, indicating that more data can be written.
3. If the internal buffer **is full** (i.e., `writableLength ≥ writableHighWaterMark`), it **returns `false`**, meaning that additional writes should wait until the `drain` event fires.
4. When the internal buffer has been drained (i.e., data is written to the destination), Node.js emits a **`drain`** event.

### **🔹 Example: Handling the `false` Return Value**
```js
import fs from 'fs';

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt", { highWaterMark: 4 });

let i = 0;
function writeData() {
    let canWrite = true;
    
    while (i < 10 && canWrite) {
        canWrite = writeStream.write(`Chunk ${i} `);
        console.log(`Writing Chunk ${i}: Can Write? ${canWrite}`);
        i++;
    }

    if (!canWrite) {
        writeStream.once("drain", writeData);  // Wait for the drain event before writing more data
    }
}

writeData();
```

### **🔹 Explanation of Example**
1. We set `highWaterMark: 4`, meaning the writable stream buffer can hold up to 4 bytes before it is considered full.
2. The loop writes multiple chunks using `writeStream.write(chunk)`.
3. If `writeStream.write(chunk)` returns `false`, it stops writing and waits for the **`drain`** event.
4. Once the buffer is cleared, the **`drain`** event is triggered, allowing us to write more data.

### **🔹 When to Use the Boolean Return Value?**
✅ **If `true`**, continue writing more data.  
❌ **If `false`**, pause writing and wait for the **`drain` event** before writing more data.

By properly handling `false`, we prevent excessive memory consumption and avoid overwhelming the writable stream.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- `writeStream.write(chunk)` returns a **boolean** indicating whether the buffer can accept more data.
- If `false`, it means the internal buffer is full and writing should be paused.
- Use the **`drain` event** to resume writing once the buffer has space.
- This mechanism helps **prevent backpressure** in Node.js streams.
