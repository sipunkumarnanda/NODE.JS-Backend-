Here are detailed explanation notes for each commented section in your code:

### **1. Initial State Section**
This part explains how to check the initial state of a Readable Stream before any data is processed.

```javascript
// Initial State
/*
console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // null in the initial state, as the stream is not yet flowing.
console.log(readStream.readableEnded); // false, the stream is not yet ended since no data has been read.
console.log(readStream.isPaused()); // false, the stream is not paused yet.
*/
```

- **`readableFlowing`**: In the initial state, this property is `null`, indicating that the stream is neither flowing nor paused yet. It starts as `null` before any data events or state changes occur.
- **`readableEnded`**: This property is `false` initially, meaning the stream has not yet finished reading. It will only become `true` after all the data has been consumed and the `end` event is triggered.
- **`isPaused()`**: This method returns `false` initially because the stream has not been paused yet. In the beginning, data flow will automatically occur unless paused by the user.

### **2. Flowing State Section**
This section explains what happens when the stream starts flowing, i.e., when it begins to read data.

```javascript
// Flowing State
/*
readStream.on("data", (chunkBuffer) => {
    console.log(chunkBuffer);  // Logs the chunk of data being read
    readStream.pause();  // Pauses the stream after the first chunk is read
    console.log(readStream.readableFlowing);  // It will be false after calling pause().
    console.log(readStream.readableEnded);  // Should still be false unless the stream is fully read.
    console.log(readStream.isPaused());  // true after calling pause(), because the stream has been paused.
});
*/
```

- **Data Event**: When the `data` event is emitted, the stream is in its **flowing state**, meaning data is being read and passed in chunks. Here, `chunkBuffer` represents each chunk of data being read.
- **`pause()`**: Calling `readStream.pause()` pauses the stream after the first chunk of data is received. The stream will stop reading data, and the `readableFlowing` state will change.
- **`readableFlowing`**: After the stream is paused, the `readableFlowing` property will be `false`, indicating that the stream is no longer actively flowing (i.e., reading).
- **`readableEnded`**: This property is still `false` because the stream hasn't ended yet, i.e., it hasn't finished reading all the data.
- **`isPaused()`**: Since the stream was paused using `pause()`, this method will return `true`, confirming that the stream is currently paused.

### **3. Ended State Section**
This section explains what happens when the stream reaches the "ended" state, i.e., after all data has been read and the `end` event is triggered.

```javascript
// Ended State
// Listening to 'data' event to read the file chunks
readStream.on("data", (chunkBuffer) => {
    // Process the chunkBuffer here if needed (e.g., log or manipulate)
});
  
// Listening to 'end' event to check the state once the stream has finished reading
readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log(readStream.readableFlowing);  // Should be null or false after stream ends
    console.log(readStream.readableEnded);  // Should be true once the stream finishes
    console.log(readStream.isPaused());  // Should be false as the stream is not paused at the end
});
```

- **`data` Event**: This event is triggered as the stream starts reading data. It can process chunks of data as they are received.
- **`end` Event**: Once the stream finishes reading all the data, the `end` event is triggered. At this point, the stream is in the **ended state**.
- **`readableFlowing`**: After the stream has ended, this property may return `null` or `false`. It indicates that the stream has stopped flowing because it has consumed all the data.
- **`readableEnded`**: This property will return `true` once the stream finishes reading all available data. It marks the transition from flowing to ended state.
- **`isPaused()`**: This method will return `false` once the stream has ended because the stream is no longer paused; it's finished reading.

### **Summary Notes:**

- **Initial State**: The stream is not flowing or paused. Both `readableFlowing` and `readableEnded` are in their default states (`null` and `false`), and the stream is not paused.
- **Flowing State**: Data is being actively read in chunks. You can pause the stream using `pause()`, which will stop the flow and change the `readableFlowing` to `false`. The `readableEnded` will remain `false` until all data is read.
- **Ended State**: The stream has read all the data and is no longer flowing. The `readableFlowing` becomes `null` or `false`, `readableEnded` becomes `true`, and `isPaused()` will return `false` since the stream is finished.

This approach helps to manage the flow of data in Node.js streams, especially when working with large files that you want to process in chunks without overwhelming the memory.
