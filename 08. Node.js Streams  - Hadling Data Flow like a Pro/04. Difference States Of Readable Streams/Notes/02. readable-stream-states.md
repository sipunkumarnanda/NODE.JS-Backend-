# **Understanding Readable Stream States in Node.js**  

In Node.js, a **Readable Stream** goes through different states during its lifecycle. To understand these states, we can use three key properties:  

- **`.readableFlowing`** → Indicates whether the stream is in **flowing mode** or **paused mode**.  
- **`.readableEnded`** → Returns `true` when the stream has finished reading all data.  
- **`.isPaused()`** → Checks whether the stream is explicitly **paused**.

## **1️⃣ Initial State (Before Reading Starts)**
### ✅ **Description:**  
- When a Readable Stream is created but not yet started, it is in the **initial state**.  
- It has not started flowing or reading any data.  

### 📌 **Properties in Initial State:**  
| Property               | Value  | Meaning |
|------------------------|--------|---------|
| `.readableFlowing`     | `null` | The stream is in its initial state (not yet flowing). |
| `.readableEnded`       | `false` | The stream hasn't finished reading since it hasn't started. |
| `.isPaused()`          | `false` | The stream is not paused because it hasn't started. |

### 📝 **Example in Initial State:**
```js
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("chars.txt");

console.log(readStream.readableFlowing);  // Output: null (Initial state)
console.log(readStream.readableEnded);    // Output: false (Not finished)
console.log(readStream.isPaused());       // Output: false (Not paused)
```

## **2️⃣ Flowing State (Actively Reading Data)**
### ✅ **Description:**  
- The stream enters the **flowing state** when data starts being read.  
- This can happen when you attach a `"data"` event listener, call `.resume()`, or use `.pipe()`.  
- In this state, data is automatically read and emitted in chunks.  

### 📌 **Properties in Flowing State:**  
| Property               | Value  | Meaning |
|------------------------|--------|---------|
| `.readableFlowing`     | `true` | The stream is actively reading data in flowing mode. |
| `.readableEnded`       | `false` | The stream has not yet finished reading. |
| `.isPaused()`          | `false` | The stream is not paused, meaning data is flowing. |

### 📝 **Example in Flowing State:**
```js
readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk); // Logs the chunk of data
    console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // Output: true (Flowing mode)
    console.log(readStream.readableEnded);   // Output: false (Not yet finished)
    console.log(readStream.isPaused());      // Output: false (Not paused)
});
```

## **3️⃣ Paused State (When Using `.pause()`)**
### ✅ **Description:**  
- The stream enters the **paused state** when `.pause()` is called.  
- In this state, the stream stops emitting data until `.resume()` is called.  

### 📌 **Properties in Paused State:**  
| Property               | Value  | Meaning |
|------------------------|--------|---------|
| `.readableFlowing`     | `false` | The stream is paused and not reading data. |
| `.readableEnded`       | `false` | The stream is not yet finished. |
| `.isPaused()`          | `true` | The stream is explicitly paused. |

### 📝 **Example of Paused State:**
```js
readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk);
    
    readStream.pause(); // Pause the stream
    console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // Output: false (Paused)
    console.log(readStream.readableEnded);   // Output: false (Not yet finished)
    console.log(readStream.isPaused());      // Output: true (Paused)
});
```

## **4️⃣ Ended State (When All Data is Read)**
### ✅ **Description:**  
- The stream enters the **ended state** when it has read all the data.  
- The `"end"` event is emitted when the stream is fully consumed.  
- After this point, no more data will be read from the stream.  

### 📌 **Properties in Ended State:**  
| Property               | Value  | Meaning |
|------------------------|--------|---------|
| `.readableFlowing`     | `false` | The stream is no longer flowing. |
| `.readableEnded`       | `true` | The stream has finished reading all data. |
| `.isPaused()`          | `false` | The stream is not paused, but it's finished. |

### 📝 **Example of Ended State:**
```js
readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Reading finished.");

    console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // Output: false (Stopped)
    console.log(readStream.readableEnded);   // Output: true (Finished reading)
    console.log(readStream.isPaused());      // Output: false (Not paused, but done)
});
```

## **🎯 Summary Table: Readable Stream States & Properties**
| State          | `.readableFlowing` | `.readableEnded` | `.isPaused()` | Description |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Initial**   | `null`           | `false`         | `false`      | Stream is created but hasn't started reading. |
| **Flowing**   | `true`           | `false`         | `false`      | Stream is actively reading data. |
| **Paused**    | `false`          | `false`         | `true`       | Stream is paused using `.pause()`. |
| **Ended**     | `false`          | `true`          | `false`      | Stream has finished reading all data. |

## **🔹 Key Takeaways**
- `.readableFlowing` tells whether the stream is **actively reading** (`true`) or **paused** (`false`).  
- `.readableEnded` becomes `true` **only when the stream has completely finished reading**.  
- `.isPaused()` returns `true` **only if the stream was explicitly paused using `.pause()`**.  
- Once the stream is ended (`"end"` event fired), it **cannot** be resumed.
