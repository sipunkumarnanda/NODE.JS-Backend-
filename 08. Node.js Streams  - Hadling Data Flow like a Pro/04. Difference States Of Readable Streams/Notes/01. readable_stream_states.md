## **Different States of Readable Streams in Node.js**  

### **Q1: What is a Stream?**
A **Stream** in Node.js is a continuous flow of data that can be read or written in chunks instead of loading the entire data into memory at once. Streams are especially useful when working with large files or real-time data transfer, as they improve **memory efficiency** and **performance**.

### **Types of Streams in Node.js**
1. **Readable Streams** → Used for reading data  
2. **Writable Streams** → Used for writing data  
3. **Duplex Streams** → Both readable and writable (e.g., sockets)  
4. **Transform Streams** → Modify or transform data while reading/writing (e.g., compression)

## **Q2: States of Readable Streams**
A readable stream in Node.js goes through multiple states, which help us understand its behavior at different points in the lifecycle.

### **1️⃣ Initial State (`null`)**
- **When?** → Before any data is read, immediately after creating a readable stream.  
- **Why?** → The stream is **not yet** flowing or paused.  
- **How to Check?** → `readStream.readableFlowing === null`  
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  import fs from "fs";
  const readStream = fs.createReadStream("file.txt");

  console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // Output: null
  ```
  **📝 Note:** The stream is in an **inactive state** and will not start reading until a data event listener is attached.

---

### **2️⃣ Flowing Mode (`true`)**
- **When?** → When a `data` event listener is attached. The stream starts reading data automatically.  
- **Why?** → In this mode, data is **continuously** read and emitted as chunks.  
- **How to Check?** → `readStream.readableFlowing === true`  
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
      console.log(chunk.toString()); // Data is flowing
      console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // true
  });
  ```
  **📝 Note:** The stream automatically switches to **flowing mode** when a `"data"` event listener is attached.

---

### **3️⃣ Paused Mode (`false`)**
- **When?** → When `.pause()` is called or no `"data"` event listener exists.  
- **Why?** → The stream **stops emitting data** but does not close.  
- **How to Check?** → `readStream.isPaused() === true` OR `readStream.readableFlowing === false`  
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
      console.log(chunk.toString());
      readStream.pause(); // Pauses the stream
      console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // false
  });
  ```
  **📝 Note:** Calling `.pause()` does **not** stop reading data from the file; it just stops emitting data events.

---

### **4️⃣ Resumed Mode (`true`)**
- **When?** → When `.resume()` is called after pausing.  
- **Why?** → The stream **resumes** reading data and emitting chunks.  
- **How to Check?** → `readStream.readableFlowing === true`  
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
      console.log(chunk.toString());
      readStream.pause(); // Pauses the stream
      setTimeout(() => {
          readStream.resume(); // Resumes the stream after 2 sec
          console.log("Resumed Stream");
      }, 2000);
  });
  ```
  **📝 Note:** This is useful for **controlling flow** when handling large amounts of data.

---

### **5️⃣ Ended State (`readableEnded: true`)**
- **When?** → When the entire file or data source has been completely read.  
- **Why?** → The stream **stops emitting data** and triggers an `"end"` event.  
- **How to Check?** → `readStream.readableEnded === true`  
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  readStream.on("end", () => {
      console.log("File reading completed!");
      console.log(readStream.readableEnded); // true
  });
  ```
  **📝 Note:** In this state, **no more data** will be emitted.

---

### **6️⃣ Closed State (`close` event)**
- **When?** → When the stream is **completely closed**.  
- **Why?** → The stream releases system resources after reading is done.  
- **How to Check?** → Listen to the `"close"` event  
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  readStream.on("close", () => {
      console.log("Stream closed!");
  });
  ```
  **📝 Note:** Closing happens **after** the `"end"` event.

### **🚀 Summary of Readable Stream States**
| State             | `readableFlowing` | `readableEnded` | Description |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Initial**      | `null`          | `false`        | Before reading starts |
| **Flowing**      | `true`          | `false`        | Actively reading data |
| **Paused**       | `false`         | `false`        | Reading is stopped temporarily |
| **Resumed**      | `true`          | `false`        | Reading continues after pausing |
| **Ended**        | `false`         | `true`         | All data is read |
| **Closed**       | `false`         | `true`         | Stream is fully closed |

### **🔥 Key Takeaways**
✅ **Readable Streams** improve performance by handling large data efficiently.  
✅ Streams have **different states** like `flowing`, `paused`, and `ended`.  
✅ `.pause()` and `.resume()` allow **controlling the data flow**.  
✅ Use `"end"` and `"close"` events to handle **stream completion**.

# 📌 **Readable Stream Properties & Methods in Node.js**

When working with **Readable Streams** in Node.js, it’s important to understand certain properties that help us track and control the stream's behavior.

---

## 1️⃣ **`.readableFlowing`**  
- This property **indicates whether the stream is currently in flowing mode** (actively reading data).
- Possible values:
  - `null` → Stream is in the **initial state** (not yet started reading).
  - `true` → Stream is **actively reading** data.
  - `false` → Stream is **paused** and waiting to be resumed.

✅ **Example:**
```js
import fs from "fs";

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt");

console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // null (initial state)

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk.toString());
  console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // true (stream is reading)
  
  readStream.pause();
  console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // false (stream is paused)
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    readStream.resume();
    console.log(readStream.readableFlowing); // true (stream resumes reading)
  }, 2000);
});
```

---

## 2️⃣ **`.readableEnded`**
- This property **checks if the stream has finished reading all data**.
- Possible values:
  - `false` → The stream is still **reading** data.
  - `true` → The stream has **finished reading** all data.

✅ **Example:**
```js
readStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log("File reading completed.");
  console.log(readStream.readableEnded); // true (stream has ended)
});
```

🔹 The `.readableEnded` property is `true` **only after the ‘end’ event is emitted**.

---

## 3️⃣ **`.isPaused()`**
- This method **returns whether the stream is paused or not**.
- Possible values:
  - `true` → The stream is **paused**.
  - `false` → The stream is **active** and reading data.

✅ **Example:**
```js
console.log(readStream.isPaused()); // false (initially not paused)

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk.toString());

  readStream.pause();
  console.log(readStream.isPaused()); // true (after pausing)

  setTimeout(() => {
    readStream.resume();
    console.log(readStream.isPaused()); // false (after resuming)
  }, 3000);
});
```

---

## **📌 Summary Table**
| Property / Method | Description | Possible Values |
|------------------|------------|----------------|
| `.readableFlowing` | Checks if the stream is reading data in flowing mode | `null` (initial), `true` (flowing), `false` (paused) |
| `.readableEnded` | Checks if the stream has finished reading all data | `false` (not ended), `true` (ended) |
| `.isPaused()` | Checks if the stream is paused | `true` (paused), `false` (not paused) |

---

### **💡 When to Use These Properties?**
- Use `.readableFlowing` **to check if the stream is actively reading or paused**.
- Use `.readableEnded` **to verify when the stream has finished reading all data**.
- Use `.isPaused()` **to track if the stream is currently paused before resuming it**.

These properties and methods help control the **flow of data efficiently**, ensuring we manage resources properly in Node.js applications. 🚀
