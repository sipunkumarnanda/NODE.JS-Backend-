# **Understanding `stdout` as a Duplex Stream in Node.js**  

## **Default Behavior of `stdout`**  
- In **Node.js**, `process.stdout` is **by default connected to the monitor (console/output screen)** when the process starts in a terminal.  
- **Behind the scenes, `stdout` is a duplex stream**, meaning it has both **readable and writable** capabilities.  
- **However, in most cases, it functions as a writable stream** (i.e., it outputs data but does not read input).  

---

## **Why Does `stdout` Work Only as a Writable Stream?**  
- The terminal controls `stdout`, allowing the process to **send output** but not receive input.  
- **By default, it behaves as a writable stream**, meaning data can be written to it, but reading from it is not typical.  
- **Example:**  
  ```javascript
  process.stdout.write("Hello, World!\n"); // Writes output to the monitor
  ```
- Unlike `stdin`, writing to `stdout` is useful in an interactive terminal session because it directly displays information.  

---

## **Can `stdout` Work as a Readable Stream?**  
Yes! Even though it **mostly functions as a writable stream**, `stdout` **is a duplex stream internally**, and its readable side can be used in certain scenarios.  

### **Example: Using `stdout` as a Readable Stream**  
This is possible when `stdout` is **piped to another process** instead of the terminal.  

```javascript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

// Spawn a process that runs a Node.js script
const child = spawn('node', ['-e', `console.log("Hello from child process")`]);

// Read data from the child process stdout
child.stdout.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received from child:", chunk.toString());
});
```

### **How This Works?**  
- The **child process writes output to its `stdout`**, which is **readable by the parent process**.  
- In this case, `stdout` behaves as a **readable stream** because its data is being received by another process.  

---

## **Alternative: Redirecting `stdout` to a File**  
Instead of printing to the console, we can **redirect `stdout` to a file**, treating it as a readable stream.  

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

// Create a writable stream to store output
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

// Spawn a process and capture its stdout
const child = spawn('node', ['-e', `console.log("Logging to file")`]);

// Pipe stdout to the writable file stream
child.stdout.pipe(writeStream);

console.log("Data is being written to output.txt");
```

### **Explanation**  
- Here, `stdout` **outputs data to a file instead of the terminal**, making it behave as a **readable stream** for the file writer.

## **Summary**  
| Stream | Default Behavior | Duplex Capability | How to Enable Readable Mode? |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| `stdout` | Writable | Yes, but rarely used | Pipe it to another process or file |
| `stdin` | Readable | Yes, but needs extra code | Use a **Duplex stream** or **child process** |
| `stderr` | Writable | No | N/A |

---

## **Key Takeaways**  
✅ `stdout` is a **duplex stream**, but it **functions as writable by default** because it prints to the terminal.  
✅ To make `stdout` **readable**, you must **redirect its output** (e.g., pipe it to another process or file).  
✅ When `stdout` is piped, it behaves like a **true duplex stream**, allowing data to be **read and written** between processes.

# **Using `stdout` as Both Readable and Writable in Node.js Streams**  

## **Understanding the Code Structure**  

Your implementation effectively demonstrates how **`stdout` behaves as both a readable and writable stream** when used in conjunction with **child processes and file streaming**.  

### **Breakdown of `stdout` Behavior in This Code**  

1. **In `childApp.js`, `stdout` is Writable**  
   - The file is **read using a readable stream (`readStream`)**.  
   - The `readStream` **pipes** the file data **to `process.stdout`**.  
   - Since `stdout` is usually a writable stream, it receives the video file data and outputs it.  
     
     ```javascript
     // childApp.js
     import fs from 'fs';

     // Create a readable stream from the video file
     const readStream = fs.createReadStream("C:\\Users\\Sipun Kumar Nanda\\Downloads\\Game.Changer.2025.720p.HEVC.DS4K.WEB-DL.Hindi.5.1-Telugu.x265-HDHub4u.Tv.mkv");

     // Pipe the video file data to stdout (Writable in this case)
     readStream.pipe(process.stdout);
     ```

2. **In `app.js`, `stdout` is Readable**  
   - A **child process (`childProcess`) is spawned** to execute `childApp.js`.  
   - The child process **sends its `stdout` stream to the parent process**.  
   - Instead of displaying the data on the terminal, the parent process **treats `stdout` as a readable stream** and pipes it into a file (`movie.mp4`).  

     ```javascript
     // app.js
     import fs from 'fs';
     import { spawn } from 'child_process';

     // Create a writable stream for the output file
     const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("movie.mp4");

     // Spawn a child process running `childApp.js`
     const childProcess = spawn('node', ['childApp.js']);

     // Pipe the stdout of the child process to the writable file stream
     childProcess.stdout.pipe(writeStream);

     console.log("Receiving video data from child process...");
     ```

---

## **How is `stdout` Acting as Both Readable and Writable?**  

| **File**       | **Stream Role** | **Behavior**  |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **`childApp.js`** | `stdout` as **Writable** | Receives the video stream from `readStream` and outputs it. |
| **`app.js`**   | `stdout` as **Readable**  | Reads `stdout` from the child process and pipes it to a file. |

### **Detailed Explanation**  

1. **Writable Mode (`childApp.js`)**  
   - `readStream.pipe(process.stdout);`  
   - Here, `stdout` **receives** the video data from `readStream` and **writes** it to the terminal (or another destination if piped).  
   
2. **Readable Mode (`app.js`)**  
   - `childProcess.stdout.pipe(writeStream);`  
   - Here, `stdout` **is treated as a readable stream**, meaning the parent process reads the data from the child's output and writes it to a file (`movie.mp4`).  

---

## **Key Takeaways**  

✅ `stdout` is **a duplex stream**, meaning it can **both read and write**.  
✅ In **`childApp.js`**, `stdout` is writable because it receives video data and outputs it.  
✅ In **`app.js`**, `stdout` is readable because the parent process reads the child's output stream.  
✅ This method efficiently transfers large data (like video files) **without buffering the entire file in memory**.  

This technique is commonly used for **real-time streaming, logging, and data processing between processes**.
