# **Understanding `stdin` as a Duplex Stream in Node.js**  

## **Default Behavior of `stdin`**  
- In **Node.js**, `process.stdin` is **by default connected to the keyboard** when the process starts in a terminal.  
- **Behind the scenes, `stdin` is a duplex stream**, meaning it has both readable and writable capabilities.  
- **However, in most cases, it functions as a readable stream** (i.e., it reads user input but does not write data).  

## **Why Does `stdin` Work Only as a Readable Stream?**  
- The terminal typically controls `stdin`, allowing the process to **receive input** but not send output back into it.  
- Writing to `stdin` doesnâ€™t make sense in an interactive terminal session because the keyboard is not meant to receive data from the process.

## **How to Make `stdin` Work as a Duplex Stream?**  
If we want `stdin` to behave as both **readable and writable**, we need to override its behavior.  

### **Example: Using Child Process for Streaming Data**  

#### **`app.js`**  
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

// Create a writable stream to save the file
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output_video.mp4");

// Spawn a child process that runs childApp.js
const childProcess = spawn('node', ['childApp.js']);

// Pipe the stdout of the child process to the writable file stream
childProcess.stdout.pipe(writeStream);

console.log("Receiving video data from child process...");
```

---

#### **`childApp.js`**  
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

// Create a readable stream from a video file
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("C:\\Users\\Sipun Kumar Nanda\\Videos\\sample-video.mp4");

// Pipe the video file data to stdout, which will send it to the parent process
readStream.pipe(process.stdout);

console.log("Streaming video file...");
```

### **How This Works?**  
1. `childApp.js` **reads video data** from a file and sends it to `stdout`.  
2. `app.js` **receives this data** via `childProcess.stdout` and writes it to `output_video.mp4`.  
3. This demonstrates **streaming data between processes** using standard input/output.  

---

## **Alternative Approach: Using a TTY Workaround**  
You can enable duplex behavior by connecting the process to another process using a **pipe** instead of a terminal.  

### **Example: Simulating a Duplex `stdin` with a Child Process**
```javascript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

const child = spawn('node', ['-e', `process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout)`]);

child.stdin.write('Hello, Duplex stdin!\n'); // Writing to stdin
child.stdin.end(); // Close the writable stream
```
### **Explanation**  
- We **spawn** a Node.js process that pipes `stdin` to `stdout`.  
- We manually **write data** to `child.stdin`, making it act like a writable stream.  
- In this case, `stdin` is behaving as **both readable and writable**, demonstrating its duplex capability.

## **Summary**  
| Stream | Default Behavior | Duplex Capability | How to Enable Duplex Mode? |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| `stdin` | Readable | Yes, but requires extra code | Use a **Duplex stream** or **spawn a child process** |
| `stdout` | Writable | No | N/A |
| `stderr` | Writable | No | N/A |

### **Key Takeaways**  
âœ… `stdin` is technically a **duplex stream**, but it is **readable by default**.  
âœ… To make `stdin` fully **duplex**, you need to **override its writable behavior** using a **custom Duplex stream** or **spawn a child process**.  
âœ… Writing to `stdin` is not useful in an interactive terminal but works in **piped processes** or **custom implementations**.  

This approach allows **real-time streaming between processes**, making `stdin` behave like a **true duplex stream**. ðŸš€
