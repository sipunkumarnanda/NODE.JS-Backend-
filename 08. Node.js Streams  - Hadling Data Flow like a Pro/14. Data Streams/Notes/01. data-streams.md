# **Topic: Data Stream**  

## **Q1. What is a Process?**  
A **process** is an instance of a program that is currently running on a computer. It includes:  
- The **program code** being executed.  
- The **system resources** it uses (e.g., memory, CPU, file handles).  
- The **execution state** (e.g., running, waiting, or terminated).  

### **Types of Processes in Node.js:**  
1. **Main Process** – The primary Node.js instance running the script.  
2. **Child Process** – A separate process created using `child_process.spawn()`, `fork()`, etc.  

### **Key Concepts of Processes in Node.js:**  
- `process` is a global object in Node.js that provides information and control over the current Node.js process.  
- Important properties of `process` include:
  - `process.pid` → Process ID.
  - `process.argv` → Arguments passed to the script.
  - `process.env` → Environment variables.
  - `process.stdin`, `process.stdout`, `process.stderr` → Standard I/O streams.

## **Q2. What is a Data Stream?**  
A **data stream** is a continuous flow of data that can be processed efficiently without needing to load the entire dataset into memory.  

### **Types of Streams in Node.js:**  
1. **Readable Streams** → Data can be read from them (e.g., `fs.createReadStream()`, `process.stdin`).  
2. **Writable Streams** → Data can be written to them (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream()`, `process.stdout`).  
3. **Duplex Streams** → Can both read and write data (e.g., `net.Socket`).  
4. **Transform Streams** → A special type of duplex stream that modifies data (e.g., `zlib.createGzip()`).  

### **Why Use Streams?**  
- **Memory Efficient:** Processes data in chunks rather than loading everything at once.  
- **Faster Processing:** Handles large files efficiently.  
- **Event-Driven:** Works asynchronously, improving performance.  

### **Example of a Readable Stream:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt', 'utf-8');

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Reading completed.');
});
```

## **Q3. What is a Duplex Stream?**  
A **duplex stream** is a type of stream that is **both readable and writable** at the same time. It can send and receive data simultaneously, making it useful for networking and communication tasks.  

### **Examples of Duplex Streams in Node.js:**  
1. **TCP Sockets (`net.Socket`)** – Can send and receive data over a network.  
2. **WebSockets (`ws` module)** – Full-duplex communication between clients and servers.  
3. **Custom Duplex Streams** – Created using the `stream.Duplex` class.  

### **Example of a Duplex Stream (TCP Socket Server)**  
```javascript
import net from 'net';

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
    console.log('Client connected.');

    // Receiving data (Readable)
    socket.on('data', (data) => {
        console.log('Received from client:', data.toString());
    });

    // Sending data (Writable)
    socket.write('Hello from server!\n');
});

server.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 5000');
});
```

### **How Duplex Streams Work?**  
- They act as both input and output channels.  
- Useful for two-way communication (e.g., chat applications, APIs, real-time data processing).  
- Unlike simple readable/writable streams, duplex streams allow simultaneous data transmission.

### **Summary**  
- **Process**: A running instance of a program with its own execution context.  
- **Data Stream**: A continuous flow of data that can be processed in chunks, improving efficiency.  
- **Duplex Stream**: A special type of stream that allows both reading and writing simultaneously, useful for real-time communication.
