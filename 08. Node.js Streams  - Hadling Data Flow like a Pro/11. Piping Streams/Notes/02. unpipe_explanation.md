### **`readStream.unpipe(writeStream)` in Node.js**  

The `unpipe()` method is used to **detach** a writable stream (`writeStream`) from a readable stream (`readStream`) that was previously connected using `pipe()`.  

---

### **Syntax**  
```javascript
readStream.unpipe(writeStream);
```

### **How It Works**  
1. `pipe()` connects a **readable stream** to a **writable stream**, allowing data to flow.  
2. `unpipe()` **stops the piping process**, preventing further data transfer.  
3. The writable stream may still process remaining buffered data, but new data won’t be written.  

---

### **Example: Using `unpipe()`**  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('source.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('destination.txt');

// Start piping data
readStream.pipe(writeStream);

// Stop piping after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
    readStream.unpipe(writeStream);
    console.log('Piping stopped manually!');
}, 2000);
```

---

### **When to Use `unpipe()`**
- To **pause or stop** data transfer dynamically.  
- When switching from one writable stream to another.  
- To prevent excessive memory usage in case of **slow or blocked** writable streams.  

📌 **Note:** If `unpipe()` is called **without arguments** (`readStream.unpipe()`), it removes all pipes, disconnecting the readable stream from all writable streams.

### **`writestream.on("pipe")` & `writestream.on("unpipe")` Events in Node.js**  

These events allow us to listen when a writable stream (`writeStream`) gets **piped** or **unpiped** from a readable stream (`readStream`).  

---

## **1️⃣ `writestream.on("pipe", (src) => {...})`**
### **When does it fire?**  
- The `"pipe"` event fires when a readable stream is **piped into** a writable stream using `pipe()`.  
- It indicates that the writable stream is now receiving data from a readable stream.  

### **Example**  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('source.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('destination.txt');

// Listening for the "pipe" event
writeStream.on("pipe", (src) => {
    console.log("Readable stream piped into writable stream.");
});

readStream.pipe(writeStream); // Triggers the "pipe" event
```
✅ **Output:**  
```
Readable stream piped into writable stream.
```
📌 **Why use it?**  
- To track when a stream starts receiving data.  
- Useful for **logging, debugging, or triggering actions** when data transfer begins.  

---

## **2️⃣ `writestream.on("unpipe", (src) => {...})`**
### **When does it fire?**  
- The `"unpipe"` event fires when a readable stream **unpipes from** a writable stream using `unpipe()`.  
- It indicates that the writable stream is no longer receiving data from the readable stream.  

### **Example**  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('source.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('destination.txt');

// Listening for the "unpipe" event
writeStream.on("unpipe", (src) => {
    console.log("Readable stream unpiped from writable stream.");
});

readStream.pipe(writeStream); // Starts piping

setTimeout(() => {
    readStream.unpipe(writeStream); // Triggers the "unpipe" event
}, 2000);
```
✅ **Output after 2 seconds:**  
```
Readable stream unpiped from writable stream.
```
📌 **Why use it?**  
- To track when a stream **disconnects** from a data source.  
- Useful for **error handling, cleanups, or stopping operations** when data transfer is interrupted.

## **🔹 Summary**
| Event | When it Fires | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **`"pipe"`** | When a **readable stream is piped** into a writable stream (`readStream.pipe(writeStream)`). | Tracks when data transfer starts. |
| **`"unpipe"`** | When a **readable stream is detached** from a writable stream (`readStream.unpipe(writeStream)`). | Tracks when data transfer stops. |

These events help **monitor stream behavior** and can be used for **logging, debugging, or custom error handling**. 🚀
