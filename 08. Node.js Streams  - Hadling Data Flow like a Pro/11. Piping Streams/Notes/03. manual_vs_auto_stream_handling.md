### **📌 Code Explanation Notes**
#### **1️⃣ Creating Readable and Writable Streams**
- `fs.createReadStream()` creates a stream to read the file **in chunks** instead of loading the whole file into memory.
- `fs.createWriteStream()` creates a stream to write the file in chunks.
- The `highWaterMark` is set to **1MB**, meaning each read/write operation processes 1MB of data at a time.

---

#### **2️⃣ Manual Handling of Backpressure**
- **Backpressure occurs when the writable stream can't process data as fast as the readable stream.**
- `writeStream.write(chunkBuffer)` returns `false` if the writable buffer is full.
- If `false`, `readStream.pause()` **pauses** reading to prevent memory overload.
- When the writable stream clears its buffer (`drain` event), `readStream.resume()` **resumes** reading.

---

#### **3️⃣ Using `pipe()` to Handle Backpressure Automatically**
- Instead of manually handling backpressure, `readStream.pipe(writeStream)` **automatically manages it**.
- This is the **recommended approach** as it ensures efficiency and prevents memory issues.

---

#### **4️⃣ Stopping Pipe After 1 Second**
- `setTimeout()` stops the piping process after **1 second** using `readStream.unpipe(writeStream)`.
- When unpiping occurs, the `"unpipe"` event is triggered, logging **"Unpiped Now"**.

---

#### **5️⃣ Handling Stream Completion**
- `"end"` event on `readStream` calls `writeStream.end()` to **properly close** the writable stream.
- `"close"` event on `writeStream` logs **"Closed"** and stops the timer.

### **🔹 Summary**
| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|------------|
| **Manual Backpressure Handling** | Uses `pause()` & `resume()` to avoid buffer overflow. |
| **Automatic Backpressure Handling** | `pipe()` does this efficiently without extra code. |
| **Stopping Pipe** | `unpipe()` stops data transfer after 1 second. |
| **Stream Completion** | `"end"` ensures `writeStream.end()` is called. |
| **Performance Tracking** | `console.time()` helps measure execution time. |

📌 **Best Practice:** Use `pipe()` unless you need custom backpressure control. 🚀
