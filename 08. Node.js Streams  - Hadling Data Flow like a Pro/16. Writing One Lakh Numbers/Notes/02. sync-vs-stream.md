# **Why Streams are Faster than Synchronous File Writing in Node.js?**  

When writing a large amount of data to a file, using **synchronous file operations (`writeFileSync` & `appendFileSync`)** takes significantly longer than using **streams (`fs.createWriteStream`)**. Let's break down why streams are much more efficient.

## **1. Understanding the Performance Difference**  

In your example, you measured execution time for two approaches:  

### **üî¥ Using Synchronous File Writing (`fs.writeFileSync` & `fs.appendFileSync`)**  
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

console.time();

for (let i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    if (i === 1) {
        fs.writeFileSync('numbers.txt', `${i}, `);
    } else {
        fs.appendFileSync('numbers.txt', `${i}, `);
    }
}

console.timeEnd();

// Time - default: ~36.250s
```
‚úÖ **Works Correctly** but **Extremely Slow** (~36 seconds).  

### **üü¢ Using Streams (`fs.createWriteStream`)**  
```javascript
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('streamNumbers.txt');

console.time();

for (let i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
    writeStream.write(`${i}, `);
}

writeStream.end(); // Close the stream

writeStream.on('finish', () => {
    console.timeEnd();
});

// Time - default: ~527.849ms (~0.5s)
```
‚úÖ **Much Faster** (~0.5 seconds compared to 36 seconds).

## **2. Why is Synchronous File Writing So Slow?**  
When using `fs.writeFileSync` and `fs.appendFileSync`, the execution is **blocking**.  

### **üî¥ How Synchronous Writing Works (Inefficient Approach)**
1. Each `fs.appendFileSync()` call **opens the file, writes to it, and closes it**.
2. This happens **100,000 times**, which is very slow because each operation:
   - Involves a separate system call.
   - Forces the CPU to wait until disk I/O is complete before continuing.
3. Since Node.js runs **single-threaded**, the entire program **pauses** on every write.  
4. This results in **extremely slow execution** (~36 seconds).

## **3. Why Are Streams Faster?**  
Node.js **streams** allow writing data in a **continuous, efficient flow**, rather than writing line-by-line.

### **üü¢ How Streams Work (Efficient Approach)**
1. **Creates a single writable stream (`fs.createWriteStream`)**.
2. Instead of writing data **one by one** and opening/closing the file repeatedly, it **writes in chunks**.
3. The write operations happen **asynchronously in the background**, meaning Node.js doesn't block execution.
4. The OS efficiently buffers the writes to the file, reducing the number of disk I/O operations.
5. After all writes are completed, `writeStream.end()` **closes the stream**.

This approach drastically **reduces execution time** to **~0.5 seconds**, compared to **~36 seconds** for synchronous writes.

## **4. Key Differences Between Sync and Stream File Writing**
| Method | Time Taken | Blocking? | File Opens & Closes | Efficiency |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| `fs.appendFileSync` | **~36.250s** | Yes (Blocking) | 100,000 times | ‚ùå Very Slow |
| `fs.createWriteStream` | **~0.5s** | No (Non-blocking) | 1 time | ‚úÖ Extremely Fast |

## **5. Best Practices & Recommendations**
- **For small files (~100 writes):** `fs.appendFileSync` is fine.  
- **For large files (thousands/millions of writes):** Always use **streams (`fs.createWriteStream`)** for better performance.  
- **For massive data handling:** Consider using `pipeline()` from Node.js for even better efficiency.
