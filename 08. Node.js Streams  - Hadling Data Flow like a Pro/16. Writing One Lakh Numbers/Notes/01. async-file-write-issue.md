## **Why Are Numbers Written Out of Order in Your Asynchronous Code?**  

You're experiencing a problem where numbers are not written sequentially when using `fs.writeFile` and `fs.appendFile`. Let's break down why this happens in great detail.

---

## **Understanding Asynchronous File Writing in Node.js**  

Your code uses `fs.writeFile` and `fs.appendFile`, both of which are **asynchronous** functions in Node.js. This means that instead of blocking the execution of the program, they allow Node.js to continue running the next lines of code while the file operations are handled in the background.

### **How Node.js Handles Asynchronous Calls**
- When you call `fs.appendFile()`, Node.js **queues the operation** and immediately moves on to the next iteration of the loop.  
- The actual writing happens later, when the system gets to processing that specific operation.  
- Since the operations are queued almost simultaneously, they **do not necessarily complete in the same order** they were called.  

This results in some numbers being written out of sequence.

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution of Your Code**
Let's analyze how your loop executes:

### **Your Original Code**
```javascript
import fs, { appendFileSync } from 'fs'

// Using Async fs.appendFile
console.time();
for (let i = 1; i <= 5000; i++) {
    if (i === 1) {
        fs.writeFile('number.txt', `${i}, `, (err) => {
            if (err) console.log(err);
        });
    } else {
        fs.appendFile('number.txt', `${i}, `, (err) => {
            if (err) console.log(err);
            if (i === 5000) {
                console.timeEnd();
            }
        });
    }
}
```
---

### **Step 1: First Iteration (`i === 1`)**
- The loop starts, and `fs.writeFile()` is called for `1`.  
- Since `fs.writeFile()` is **asynchronous**, Node.js **does not** wait for it to complete. Instead, it immediately moves on to the next iteration (`i = 2`).

### **Step 2: Remaining Iterations (`i = 2` to `5000`)**
- For each number from `2` to `5000`, `fs.appendFile()` is called.  
- These calls are **queued** in the event loop **almost simultaneously**.  

At this point, there are **4999 `fs.appendFile()` operations** waiting to execute, but their completion **depends on the system's scheduling**.

---

## **Why Numbers Are Written Out of Order**
### **1. Non-Blocking Nature of Asynchronous Calls**
- Since `fs.appendFile()` does **not** block execution, the next iteration of the loop runs before the previous write completes.  
- Multiple calls are added to the event loop **at nearly the same time**.  

### **2. Operating System Disk Scheduling**
- The actual **order in which these operations complete is unpredictable**.  
- The operating system manages file I/O with disk buffers and background writes, **which may process operations in an arbitrary order**.

### **3. Event Loop Scheduling & Execution**
- Node.js processes file I/O using the event loop and a thread pool (via `libuv`).  
- While each `fs.appendFile()` call gets added to the event loop, the **execution order of callbacks is not guaranteed**.  
- This means some later numbers might get written before earlier numbers, causing the **disordered output**.

## **Example of What Happens Internally**
Imagine the following file operations being queued asynchronously:

| Iteration (`i`) | `fs.appendFile()` Call | When It Actually Writes |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 2             | Queued              | Completes 4th         |
| 3             | Queued              | Completes 2nd         |
| 4             | Queued              | Completes 1st         |
| 5             | Queued              | Completes 3rd         |

This means your file might end up looking like this:
```
1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, ...
```
Instead of the expected:
```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
```
This happens because **the event loop does not guarantee order** when handling asynchronous file operations.

## **How to Fix This Issue**
To **ensure sequential writing**, you need to **force Node.js to wait** for each operation to complete before moving to the next. Here are two solutions:

### **✅ Solution 1: Use `fs.appendFileSync()` (Synchronous Writing)**
Using synchronous file operations ensures that **each write completes before moving to the next iteration**.

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

console.time();
for (let i = 1; i <= 5000; i++) {
    if (i === 1) {
        fs.writeFileSync('number.txt', `${i}, `);
    } else {
        fs.appendFileSync('number.txt', `${i}, `);
    }
}
console.timeEnd();
```
✅ **Why This Works:**  
- `fs.writeFileSync()` and `fs.appendFileSync()` are **blocking**, meaning the loop **waits for each write to finish** before moving to the next number.  
- This guarantees **correct sequential order**.

---

### **✅ Solution 2: Use `async/await` with `fs/promises`**
Instead of using callbacks, we can use `async/await` to ensure **each append completes before moving to the next**.

```javascript
import { writeFile, appendFile } from 'fs/promises';

async function writeNumbers() {
    console.time();
    await writeFile('number.txt', '1, '); // Write first number

    for (let i = 2; i <= 5000; i++) {
        await appendFile('number.txt', `${i}, `);
    }

    console.timeEnd();
}

writeNumbers();
```
✅ **Why This Works:**  
- The `await` keyword ensures that **each write operation finishes before the next one starts**.  
- This eliminates race conditions, ensuring that numbers are written **in the correct order**.

## **Final Takeaways**
- **Asynchronous file writes (`fs.appendFile`) are non-blocking**, meaning they don't wait for previous writes to complete.  
- **Node.js event loop schedules file writes arbitrarily**, leading to out-of-order execution.  
- **To maintain order, use synchronous (`fs.appendFileSync`) or async/await (`fs/promises`).**  
- **Understanding event-driven architecture in Node.js helps avoid such issues.**
