### Custom `require` Function in Node.js: Detailed Notes

In the provided code, you have implemented your own version of the `require` function using the `fs` (File System) module to read the content of a JavaScript file and then execute it using `eval()`. This approach mimics how Node.js `require()` works at a very basic level but with custom handling for modules.

### Explanation of Code:

#### `loadModule()` Function:

```javascript
function loadModule(path) {
   const fs = require('fs');
   const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(path).toString();

   return (function(send) {
      // Module code goes here
      eval(fileContent); // Evaluates the code of the module in the current context
      return send;
   })({});
}
```

- **fs.readFileSync(path)**: This reads the content of the file at the given path synchronously. The result is a Buffer, which is then converted to a string using `.toString()`.
- **eval()**: This is used to execute the JavaScript code (read from the file) in the current context. The `eval()` function takes a string and evaluates it as JavaScript code. In this case, the content of the `math.js` file is evaluated.
- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**: The file content is evaluated inside a function that is immediately invoked. This function takes an object `send`, which is initially an empty object `{}`. The module's exports will be placed inside this object.

#### Example: Loading and Using the Module

```javascript
const value = loadModule('./math.js');
console.log(value); // Logs the entire module's exports

console.log(value.a); // Accesses properties from the module (like `a` in `math.js`)
```

- The result of `loadModule` is an object that contains the module's exports (i.e., the contents of `math.js`).
- After the module is loaded, the properties of the returned object can be accessed, such as `value.a`.

#### Example: Handling Functions in the Module

```javascript
const { sum } = loadModule('./sum.js');
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Calls the sum function from the module
```

- **Destructuring**: In the case where the module exports a function (like `sum`), the code destructures the returned object to extract the function `sum`.
- `sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` calls the `sum` function which was exported from `sum.js`.

### Detailed Notes:

1. **The Core Idea**:
   - Your custom `loadModule()` function reads a file from the filesystem and dynamically executes its contents.
   - The `eval()` function is used to execute the JavaScript code in the context of the function. The module's exports are returned as an object (`send`), which is populated with the variables declared inside the file.

2. **Usage of `eval()`**:
   - The `eval()` function is a powerful JavaScript feature that evaluates a string of code as if it were part of the running program.
   - In this case, it allows executing the code from the module file and adding its exports to the `send` object.
   - **Caution**: Using `eval()` comes with security risks because it can execute any arbitrary code. You should avoid using `eval()` in production code unless absolutely necessary and if the source of the code is trusted.

3. **Modifying Node.js Module System**:
   - The Node.js `require()` function works by caching modules and resolving dependencies. Your `loadModule()` function is a basic, simplified version of how modules are loaded in Node.js but lacks features such as module caching, circular dependency handling, etc.
   - Your approach does not utilize Node’s `require.cache` or `Module` class, which are integral to how Node.js manages modules.

4. **Exports in Modules**:
   - The module's code inside `math.js` or `sum.js` defines variables and functions. These are implicitly assigned to the `send` object inside the `loadModule()` function.
   - The returned `send` object will contain whatever variables or functions were declared in the module.
   - For example, if `math.js` contains:
     ```javascript
     let a = 5;
     let b = 10;
     ```
     Then the `value` object returned by `loadModule()` will have properties `a` and `b`.

5. **Limitation**:
   - Your `loadModule()` function does not implement any of the optimizations that Node.js’ built-in `require()` function provides, such as caching or dependency resolution. This means if you call `loadModule()` multiple times for the same module, it will re-execute the module code each time.
   - The approach also lacks the built-in handling of relative paths or package resolution that Node.js' `require()` does.

### Conclusion:
You have successfully implemented a custom module loader using the `fs` module and `eval()`. This simulates basic functionality similar to `require()` in Node.js, but it is a simplified version and lacks many features such as module caching, error handling, and dependency resolution.
