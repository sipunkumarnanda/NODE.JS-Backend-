### Understanding NPX in Depth

## Q1. What is NPX? Explain in Depth.

- **NPX** is a command-line utility that is bundled with `npm` (Node Package Manager) starting from version 5.2.0. It is primarily used to execute binaries (commands) from Node.js packages without needing to install the package globally or even locally.
- The main advantage of `npx` is that it allows you to run CLI commands (such as `create-react-app`, `vite`, etc.) without worrying about managing global packages or their versions.
- NPX can execute:
  - **Global packages**: Without installing them globally, it can fetch the latest version of the command directly.
  - **Local packages**: It can also run binaries located inside `node_modules/.bin` in a local project.
  - **GitHub or any URL**: It can run commands from a GitHub repository or any online location without having to install the repository's contents.
  
For example, to run `create-react-app` without installing it globally:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Q2. How to Know Where Globally Installed Packages Are Present? Explain in Depth.

- To determine where globally installed npm packages are stored, you can use the command:
  
  ```bash
  npm root -g
  ```
  
- This command will return the path to the global `node_modules` directory. The `-g` flag specifies that you want to check global installations.
  
  Example output (it may vary based on your environment):
  
  ```
  C:\Users\Sipun Kumar Nanda\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
  ```

- In this directory, you will find globally installed packages and their respective executables. These are the packages that are available to be used from anywhere in your terminal.

- By default, global packages are installed in a global directory managed by npm, which is typically outside your project folder. You can use this directory to manage or troubleshoot global packages.

# Understanding NPX in Depth

## Q3. Does NPX Help to Install Only CLI Apps? Explain.

**No**, NPX is not limited to installing only CLI (Command-Line Interface) applications. It is a versatile tool that allows you to run commands from packages, whether they are CLI tools or non-CLI packages. Let's break down its usage in different scenarios:

### How NPX Works:
- **Running CLI Tools**: 
  - **Local Packages**: NPX will search for the executable in the local `node_modules/.bin` directory of your project (if the package is installed there).
  - **Global Packages**: If the package is installed globally (using `npm install -g`), NPX will use that version to run the command.
  - **Directly from NPM Registry**: If the package is not installed either locally or globally, NPX will download the latest version of the package from the NPM registry, run the command, and then remove the package once the execution is complete.

- **Running Non-CLI Packages**: 
  - NPX can also execute non-CLI packages. For instance, if you want to execute a function from a library, you could use NPX to run that package without installing it permanently in your project. For example, `npx lodash` can run a utility function from the lodash library without installing the entire package globally or locally.

- **Not Limited to CLI Packages**: NPX can be used for both CLI and non-CLI packages, making it a more flexible tool than just a CLI tool runner. It can execute JavaScript code, packages that are not necessarily designed to be run from the command line, or even execute files from GitHub repositories.

#### Example 1: Running a Non-CLI Package
If you wanted to execute a specific function from a package like `lodash` using NPX, you could do something like this:
```bash
npx -c "console.log(require('lodash').random(0, 100));"
```
This example executes the `random` function from the `lodash` package directly in the terminal without installing `lodash` globally or locally.

#### Example 2: Running CLI Tools
If you want to run a globally installed CLI tool like `vite`:
```bash
npx vite
```
NPX will use the global installation of `vite` and execute the command.

## Q4. If We Type a Package Name in the Terminal, It Runs Without `npx`. Why?

- When you type a package name in the terminal, you are likely invoking a globally installed package.
  
- **Global packages**: If a package is installed globally (e.g., using `npm install -g <package-name>`), the executable file is placed in the global `node_modules/.bin` directory. This directory is usually added to your systemâ€™s `PATH`, which allows you to run the package directly by name.
  
  For example, if you have `vite` installed globally, you can simply type:
  ```bash
  vite
  ```
  And it will run, because the terminal can find it in the `PATH`.

- **Local packages**: If a package is installed locally, you would typically run it through NPX or via a script in the `package.json` file, since it is not automatically added to your system `PATH`.

## Q5. What is the Difference Between `npm` and `npm create`? Explain.

### `npm`:
- **`npm`** (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to manage packages (install, update, remove) and handle dependencies in a project.
- Common `npm` commands include:
  - `npm install <package>`: Installs a package in the current directory or globally.
  - `npm install`: Installs all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
  - `npm run <script>`: Executes a script defined in the `package.json` file.
  
### `npm create`:
- **`npm create`** is a shorthand for running package binaries or initializing projects using a package. It is typically used to bootstrap new projects or run commands from scaffolding tools.
  
- For example, running:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest
  ```
  will run the `vite` CLI tool to initialize a new Vite project. This is equivalent to using NPX with a `create` command:
  ```bash
  npx create-vite@latest
  ```

  The key difference is that `npm create` was introduced to make it easier to start new projects without needing to use `npx` explicitly. It is designed to simplify project creation using official project generators.

  ## Q5. Difference Between `npm` and `npm create`. Explain in Depth with a Table.

**`npm`** and **`npm create`** are both commands related to Node.js and package management, but they are used for different purposes. Here's a detailed breakdown of both:

### **`npm`**:
- **Purpose**: Used for managing Node.js packages and dependencies, installing them, and running scripts.
- **Common Uses**:
  - Install packages locally or globally (`npm install <package-name>`).
  - Run defined scripts in the `package.json` file (`npm run <script-name>`).
  - Manage project dependencies (`npm install`).
  - Publish packages to the npm registry.

### **`npm create`**:
- **Purpose**: A shorthand for initiating a new project using package binaries, especially for bootstrapping new applications or starting new projects based on template packages.
- **Common Uses**:
  - Used for generating new projects by utilizing package templates.
  - It simplifies the process of creating projects with popular tools like `create-react-app` or `vite`.

Here is a **table** that compares the two commands in depth:

| **Feature**                | **`npm`**                                          | **`npm create`**                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | General-purpose package management tool          | Specifically for creating new projects or scaffolding |
| **Used For**                | Installing, updating, and removing packages      | Bootstrapping new projects using templates or binaries|
| **Common Commands**         | `npm install`, `npm run`, `npm publish`           | `npm create react-app`, `npm create vite`             |
| **Scope**                   | Works with existing projects and dependencies    | Works for initializing new projects from templates   |
| **Availability**            | Available for all npm-managed projects           | Available starting from npm 7+                        |
| **Use Case**                | Managing dependencies and scripts in a project   | Creating a new project with a predefined template     |

### Example of `npm`:
To install a package locally:
```bash
npm install lodash
```

### Example of `npm create`:
To create a new React project:
```bash
npm create react-app my-app
```
This runs the `react-app` template from the official `create-react-app` package, without the need to install it globally or manually.
