### Understanding NPX in Depth

## Q1. What is NPX? Explain in Depth.

- **NPX** is a command-line utility that is bundled with `npm` (Node Package Manager) starting from version 5.2.0. It is primarily used to execute binaries (commands) from Node.js packages without needing to install the package globally or even locally.
- The main advantage of `npx` is that it allows you to run CLI commands (such as `create-react-app`, `vite`, etc.) without worrying about managing global packages or their versions.
- NPX can execute:
  - **Global packages**: Without installing them globally, it can fetch the latest version of the command directly.
  - **Local packages**: It can also run binaries located inside `node_modules/.bin` in a local project.
  - **GitHub or any URL**: It can run commands from a GitHub repository or any online location without having to install the repository's contents.
  
For example, to run `create-react-app` without installing it globally:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Q2. How to Know Where Globally Installed Packages Are Present? Explain in Depth.

- To determine where globally installed npm packages are stored, you can use the command:
  
  ```bash
  npm root -g
  ```
  
- This command will return the path to the global `node_modules` directory. The `-g` flag specifies that you want to check global installations.
  
  Example output (it may vary based on your environment):
  
  ```
  C:\Users\Sipun Kumar Nanda\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
  ```

- In this directory, you will find globally installed packages and their respective executables. These are the packages that are available to be used from anywhere in your terminal.

- By default, global packages are installed in a global directory managed by npm, which is typically outside your project folder. You can use this directory to manage or troubleshoot global packages.

# Understanding NPX in Depth

## Q3. Does NPX Help to Install Only CLI Apps? Explain.

**No**, NPX is not limited to installing only CLI (Command-Line Interface) applications. It is a versatile tool that allows you to run commands from packages, whether they are CLI tools or non-CLI packages. Let's break down its usage in different scenarios:

### How NPX Works:
- **Running CLI Tools**: 
  - **Local Packages**: NPX will search for the executable in the local `node_modules/.bin` directory of your project (if the package is installed there).
  - **Global Packages**: If the package is installed globally (using `npm install -g`), NPX will use that version to run the command.
  - **Directly from NPM Registry**: If the package is not installed either locally or globally, NPX will download the latest version of the package from the NPM registry, run the command, and then remove the package once the execution is complete.

- **Running Non-CLI Packages**: 
  - NPX can also execute non-CLI packages. For instance, if you want to execute a function from a library, you could use NPX to run that package without installing it permanently in your project. For example, `npx lodash` can run a utility function from the lodash library without installing the entire package globally or locally.

- **Not Limited to CLI Packages**: NPX can be used for both CLI and non-CLI packages, making it a more flexible tool than just a CLI tool runner. It can execute JavaScript code, packages that are not necessarily designed to be run from the command line, or even execute files from GitHub repositories.

#### Example 1: Running a Non-CLI Package
If you wanted to execute a specific function from a package like `lodash` using NPX, you could do something like this:
```bash
npx -c "console.log(require('lodash').random(0, 100));"
```
This example executes the `random` function from the `lodash` package directly in the terminal without installing `lodash` globally or locally.

#### Example 2: Running CLI Tools
If you want to run a globally installed CLI tool like `vite`:
```bash
npx vite
```
NPX will use the global installation of `vite` and execute the command.

---
## Q4. If We Type a Package Name in the Terminal, It Runs Without `npx`. Why?

- When you type a package name in the terminal, you are likely invoking a globally installed package.
  
- **Global packages**: If a package is installed globally (e.g., using `npm install -g <package-name>`), the executable file is placed in the global `node_modules/.bin` directory. This directory is usually added to your system’s `PATH`, which allows you to run the package directly by name.
  
  For example, if you have `vite` installed globally, you can simply type:
  ```bash
  vite
  ```
  And it will run, because the terminal can find it in the `PATH`.

- **Local packages**: If a package is installed locally, you would typically run it through NPX or via a script in the `package.json` file, since it is not automatically added to your system `PATH`.

### 5. In-Depth Explanation of `npx` vs `npm create`
---

## **5. What is `npx`?**

### **Purpose:**
`npx` is a utility that comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager). Its primary function is to **execute binaries** from npm packages, but without the need to install them globally. This makes `npx` useful for running commands from CLI tools or executing scripts on-demand.

### **How `npx` Works:**
- `npx` looks for the executable in your project's `node_modules/.bin/` directory (if the command is installed locally).
- If the package is not installed locally, it searches for the package in the **npm registry** and runs the command directly from there.
- It **does not require a global installation** of the tool, so it helps you avoid polluting your global npm space.

### **Examples:**

#### **1. Run Create React App Without Global Installation**:
Suppose you want to create a new React project, but you don’t want to install `create-react-app` globally on your system. With `npx`, you can run this command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This command will:
1. Look for the `create-react-app` package in your **local project directory**.
2. If not found locally, it will fetch the latest version from the **npm registry**.
3. Run the `create-react-app` CLI tool to create a new React project called `my-app`.

Notice that you don’t need to install `create-react-app` globally on your system, which saves space and prevents versioning conflicts.

#### **2. Run One-Time Package Usage:**

If you want to execute a tool once without worrying about versioning or installation, `npx` is great for this. For example, you might want to run a package that generates random numbers:

```bash
npx chance
```

This runs the `chance` package (a library for generating random data) **without installing it**. You don’t need to worry about managing versions or dependencies.

### **Why Use `npx`?**
- **Quick, one-time usage** of any package or binary without installing it globally.
- Saves space by not requiring a permanent installation of every tool you use.
- Avoids dependency/version conflicts by always fetching the latest version of the package.
- Great for experimenting with tools or trying things out without installing packages permanently.

## **2. What is `npm create`?**

### **Purpose:**
`npm create` is a command introduced in **npm 7+** to simplify project creation. It is essentially shorthand for running project templates or scaffolding tools (such as `create-react-app`, `vite`, etc.) directly from npm’s registry.

The goal of `npm create` is to streamline **project initialization** by using packages that are specifically designed for **bootstrapping new projects**. This eliminates the need to manually use `npx` or worry about template installation.

### **How `npm create` Works:**
- When you run `npm create`, it essentially invokes a specific package (often a project template) to initialize a new project.
- It is designed to help developers **quickly scaffold** a new application without manually installing CLI tools like `create-react-app` or `vite` beforehand.
  
`npm create` is an **abbreviated version** of `npx`, with a focus on simplifying project creation.

### **Example:**

#### **1. Create a React Project Using `npm create`:**

Instead of using `npx`, you can use `npm create` to bootstrap a new React project:

```bash
npm create react-app my-app
```

This command:
1. Runs the official `create-react-app` project generator.
2. Sets up a new React application in the `my-app` folder.
3. You don’t need to install `create-react-app` globally, and the template is fetched and executed automatically.

Notice that this is more **concise** and **simplified** compared to using `npx`.

#### **2. Create a Vite Project Using `npm create`:**

Similarly, if you want to create a new Vite project, you can do so with `npm create`:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

This runs the **Vite CLI** and creates a new Vite project. Again, there’s no need to install `vite` globally or use `npx` explicitly.

### **Why Use `npm create`?**
- **Simplifies project creation** by directly using template tools like `create-react-app` and `vite`.
- Makes the project initialization process cleaner and easier to execute.
- It’s a **newer feature** that abstracts away the need to use `npx` for bootstrapping projects.

## **Key Differences Between `npx` and `npm create`**

Both commands have overlapping functionalities but are designed for different use cases. Let’s explore their differences in a detailed comparison table.

| **Feature**               | **`npx`**                                      | **`npm create`**                               |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Execute any Node.js package, locally or remotely, without installing it globally. | Initialize new projects using templates or scaffolding tools. |
| **Usage**                  | Run a single command or script without installing the package permanently. | Generate new projects from a package template, like `create-react-app`. |
| **Command Example**        | `npx create-react-app my-app`                  | `npm create react-app my-app`                  |
| **Installation Requirement** | Does not require global installation of packages. | Uses predefined templates to create a new project, no global installation needed. |
| **Scope**                  | Executes any binary or CLI tool from a package (local or remote). | Primarily for bootstrapping new projects with popular templates. |
| **Availability**           | Available with npm 5.2+                        | Available starting from npm 7+                  |
| **Common Use Case**        | Running a tool or executing a script without permanent installation. | Creating a new project with a predefined template (e.g., React, Vite). |
| **Example Use Case**       | Test a package, run a one-time command, or execute a CLI tool. | Set up a new project using a tool like `create-react-app`. |

### **When to Use `npx`:**
- **One-time execution**: When you need to execute a command or package without installing it globally.
- **Testing packages**: Ideal for running a tool without permanently adding it to your project.
- **Temporary tools**: When you don’t want to install CLI tools globally (e.g., `create-react-app`, `vite`).

#### **Example:**
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This runs `create-react-app` once to create a new React project without installing it globally.

---

### **When to Use `npm create`:**
- **Project Initialization**: When you are starting a new project based on a template or boilerplate, such as `create-react-app` or `vite`.
- **Simplified usage**: When you prefer a **shorter syntax** for initializing projects with template tools.

#### **Example:**
```bash
npm create react-app my-app
```

This initializes a new React project using `create-react-app` without needing `npx`.

---

## **Conclusion:**

- **`npx`** is a versatile tool that allows you to **execute commands and binaries** from npm packages, whether they are installed locally or fetched from the npm registry.
- **`npm create`** is a simplified version of `npx` specifically designed to **initialize new projects** using predefined templates (like `create-react-app` or `vite`).
- Use **`npx`** for **one-time command executions**, and **`npm create`** for **project creation** from templates.
