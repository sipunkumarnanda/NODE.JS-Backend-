### What Does NPX Do?

- NPX is a command-line utility that comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager) and is used to execute binaries (commands) from Node.js packages without the need to install them globally. It can also be used to execute commands from local `node_modules` or even directly from GitHub and other repositories.

- NPX does this by searching for a specific file or command and executing it. It simplifies the process of running CLI commands without needing to install the package globally or worrying about managing dependencies.

## **NPX Execution Process (Steps 1 to 5)**

NPX is a powerful tool that helps run Node.js binaries without the need to install them globally. When you run a command like `npx hello`, it follows a detailed process to locate the package and execute it. Let’s break down each step of this process in depth:

### **Step 1: Search for `package.json` in the Current Directory**
When you run `npx <command>`, NPX first checks the **current working directory** for a **`package.json`** file. 

#### **Why `package.json`?**
- **`package.json`** is the manifest file for a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and custom configurations.
- If the package you’re trying to execute is defined as a **local command** within the `bin` field of the `package.json`, NPX will find and execute it from here.

#### **What NPX Does:**
1. NPX first checks if there is a `package.json` file in the current directory.
2. Then, it looks for the **`bin`** field inside `package.json`, which maps command names to executable files.
   
For example:
```json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "bin": {
    "hello": "app.js"
  }
}
```

In this case, if you run `npx hello`, NPX finds the `hello` key in the `bin` field and executes the corresponding file (`app.js`).

#### **Why is this Step Important?**
- **Local execution**: This allows you to run local commands or custom scripts without needing to install them globally.
- **Package specific commands**: If a package you’re using defines CLI commands (in the `bin` field), NPX can run them directly.

### **Step 2: Search in `node_modules/.bin/` (Local Node Modules Bin)**
If NPX doesn’t find a `package.json` or the `bin` field for the command, it proceeds to check if the package exists **locally** in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory. 

#### **Where is this located?**
- `node_modules/.bin/` is a directory inside your project’s `node_modules` folder that stores the executables of all locally installed dependencies.
  
#### **Why is this Important?**
- When you install a package locally (via `npm install <package>`), executables (CLI tools) are placed in the `node_modules/.bin/` folder.
- **Local binaries**: You can run these binaries directly through NPX without needing to install them globally.

For example:
- If you have a local package `vite` installed, its binary will be located at `node_modules/.bin/vite`. When you run `npx vite`, NPX will locate this file and execute it.

#### **What NPX Does:**
- NPX will look for a matching executable in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory of the current working directory.
- If found, it executes the command.

### **Step 3: Search in Global npm Folder**
If NPX doesn’t find the executable locally, it will search for it in the **global npm folder**.

#### **Where is the global npm folder?**
- On **Windows**, the global npm folder is typically located at:
  ```
  C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\npm
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**, it is typically located at:
  ```
  /usr/local/bin/
  ```

#### **Why is this Important?**
- **Global installation**: Some packages are installed globally on your system (via `npm install -g <package>`). Global installations make it easier to run command-line tools across multiple projects.
- For example, if you have `vite` or `eslint` installed globally, you can run `npx vite` or `npx eslint` in any directory.

#### **What NPX Does:**
1. NPX checks if the package is installed globally.
2. If a global version of the package exists, NPX will execute it.

### **Step 4: Search in NPX Cache**
If NPX doesn’t find the executable globally, it will check its **local cache**. The **cache** is used to store previously downloaded binaries and packages to avoid downloading them again.

#### **Where is the NPX cache located?**
- On **Windows**, the cache is usually stored at:
  ```
  C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\npx\cache
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**, it’s located at:
  ```
  ~/.npm/_npx/
  ```

#### **Why is this Important?**
- **Cache for optimization**: The NPX cache helps avoid redundant downloads of the same package. If you’ve already run a package via NPX previously, it will check the cache to see if the same version is available.
- This optimizes performance by speeding up the execution of commonly used packages and saving bandwidth.

#### **What NPX Does:**
- NPX will check if the requested package was previously downloaded and stored in the cache.
- If a matching cached version is found, NPX will execute it directly from the cache without downloading it again.

#### **Example:**
- You run `npx create-react-app`. NPX downloads and caches the package.
- On subsequent runs of `npx create-react-app`, NPX uses the cached version instead of downloading it again.

---

### **Step 5: Search in npm Registry and Prompt to Install**
If NPX does not find the package in any of the previous steps (local, global, or cache), it will check the **npm registry**.

#### **What is the npm registry?**
- The **npm registry** is the central repository for all public packages and modules. It is the source from where packages are downloaded when you use npm or NPX.
  
#### **Why is this Important?**
- **Fallback option**: The npm registry is the ultimate fallback. If the package isn’t found locally or globally, NPX will fetch it from the registry and prompt you to install it.
- **Installing via NPX**: NPX not only finds but also **installs** the package temporarily before executing it. This means you don’t have to manually install the package before running it.

#### **What NPX Does:**
1. If NPX doesn’t find the package locally, globally, or in the cache, it will **search the npm registry** for the requested package.
2. If the package is found in the npm registry, NPX will **prompt you to install** it. Once you accept, it will download and install the package.
3. After installation, NPX will execute the command immediately.

#### **Example:**
- When you run `npx hello` for the first time, NPX might ask you to install it.
- After the installation, it executes the command.

### **Summary of Steps:**

1. **Step 1: Search in `package.json`** – NPX first looks in the current working directory for a `package.json` file and its `bin` field to run locally defined commands.
2. **Step 2: Search in `node_modules/.bin/`** – If not found in `package.json`, NPX checks the `node_modules/.bin/` directory for a locally installed package.
3. **Step 3: Search in Global npm Folder** – If not found locally, NPX checks if the package is installed globally on the system.
4. **Step 4: Search in NPX Cache** – If the package is not globally installed, NPX checks its local cache for previously downloaded versions.
5. **Step 5: Search in npm Registry** – Finally, NPX will download the package from the npm registry if none of the previous steps succeed.
