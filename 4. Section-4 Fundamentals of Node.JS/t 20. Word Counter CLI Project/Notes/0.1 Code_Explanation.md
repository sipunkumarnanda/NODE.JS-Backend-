### Explanation of the Code in Detail

This code is a **Word Counter CLI Tool** in Node.js that processes a text file and counts the frequency of each word in the file. It also counts how many times a specific word (given as the third command-line argument) appears in the file. Let's break down the entire code step by step and explain it in detail.

### 1. Importing Modules

```js
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
```
- **`readFile`**: The `readFile` function from the `fs/promises` module is used to read files asynchronously. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to the contents of the file.
- **`node:fs/promises`**: This is the modern way to work with asynchronous file system operations in Node.js. It is part of the Node.js built-in `fs` module that works with Promises instead of callbacks.

### 2. Getting the File Path from Command-Line Arguments

```js
const filePath = process.argv[2]
```
- **`process.argv`**: This is an array containing the command-line arguments passed when running the Node.js script.
  - `process.argv[0]`: Path to Node.js executable.
  - `process.argv[1]`: Path to the script being executed (in this case, `app.js`).
  - `process.argv[2]`: The third argument is the path to the file you want to process (e.g., `./file-2.txt`).
  
This line is capturing the path of the text file from the command-line arguments.

### 3. Reading the File Content Asynchronously

```js
const fileContent = await readFile(filePath , 'utf-8')
```
- **`await`**: This keyword pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved. In this case, it waits for the `readFile` function to finish reading the file and return its content.
- **`'utf-8'`**: This argument specifies the character encoding to be used when reading the file. `'utf-8'` ensures the file is read as a string, not a `Buffer`.

At this point, `fileContent` will contain the entire content of the file as a string.

### 4. Splitting the File Content into Words

```js
const wordArray = fileContent.split(/[\W]/).filter((w) => w)
```
- **`split(/[\W]/)`**: This splits the content of the file into an array of words using a regular expression (`/[\W]/`), which matches non-word characters (anything that is not a letter, digit, or underscore).
  - `\W`: This is a shorthand for any character that is **not** a word character (not `[A-Za-z0-9_]`).
  - The result is an array of words, but it may include empty strings because consecutive non-word characters can split the content into empty strings.

- **`filter((w) => w)`**: This filters out any empty strings from the resulting array. It removes unwanted empty items that may appear if there were consecutive non-word characters.

After this step, `wordArray` will be an array containing all the words in the file, cleaned of non-word characters.

### 5. Counting the Frequency of Each Word

```js
const wordsCount = {}
wordArray.forEach((word) => {
    if(word in wordsCount){
        wordsCount[word] += 1
    } else {
        wordsCount[word] = 1
    }
})
```
- **`wordsCount`**: This is an empty object where the words will be stored as keys, and their frequencies (number of occurrences) will be stored as values.
- **`forEach`**: The `forEach` method iterates over the `wordArray`, processing each word one by one.
- **`if(word in wordsCount)`**: This checks if the word already exists as a key in the `wordsCount` object.
  - If the word exists, it increments the value (frequency) of that word by `1`.
  - If the word doesn't exist, it adds the word as a new key and initializes its frequency to `1`.

At the end of this step, `wordsCount` will contain the count of each word in the file.

### 6. Counting a Specific Word from the Command-Line Argument (Task 3)

```js
const obj = {}
const thirdArg = process.argv[3]
wordArray.forEach((word) => {
    if(word === thirdArg){
        obj[thirdArg] = (obj[thirdArg] || 0) + 1;
    }
})
console.log(obj);
```
- **`obj`**: This is an empty object where the frequency of a specific word (passed as the third argument) will be stored.
- **`thirdArg`**: This captures the third argument passed to the script (i.e., the word for which the count will be calculated).
- **`wordArray.forEach`**: The code iterates over each word in the `wordArray`.
  - **`if(word === thirdArg)`**: This checks if the current word matches the word passed as the third command-line argument (`thirdArg`).
  - **`obj[thirdArg] = (obj[thirdArg] || 0) + 1`**:
    - This is a shorthand for checking if the word exists in the `obj` object.
    - **`obj[thirdArg]`**: This accesses the property of the object with the key equal to the word passed in `thirdArg`.
    - **`(obj[thirdArg] || 0)`**: If the word doesn't exist in the object, `obj[thirdArg]` will be `undefined`. The `|| 0` part ensures that `undefined` is treated as `0` (so the first occurrence of the word is counted as 1).
    - **`+ 1`**: This increments the count by 1 every time the word is found.

After this loop, the object `obj` will contain the count of the specific word passed as the third argument.

### 7. Explanation of NaN Issue when `obj[thirdArg] = 0` is Commented Out

```js
// obj[thirdArg] = 0
obj[thirdArg] = (obj[thirdArg] || 0) + 1;
```
- **Why `obj[thirdArg] = 0` is important**:
  - If you don't initialize `obj[thirdArg]` with a value (like `0`), the first time you try to increment `obj[thirdArg]`, it will be `undefined`.
  - **`undefined + 1`** results in `NaN` (Not-a-Number), because you can't add a number to `undefined`.

Example:
```js
let obj = {};
console.log(obj["apple"]);  // undefined
obj["apple"] += 1;          // NaN
```

- **How `(obj[thirdArg] || 0) + 1` solves it**:
  - By using `(obj[thirdArg] || 0)`, if the key `obj[thirdArg]` does not exist, it will default to `0`, preventing `undefined` from being added to `1`.

### Conclusion

This code provides a simple CLI tool for counting word frequencies in a text file and counting how many times a specific word appears in the file. The key concepts involved include:
- **`process.argv`**: Accessing command-line arguments.
- **Asynchronous file reading**: Using `readFile` to read files asynchronously.
- **Regular expressions**: Splitting the file content into words using a regex (`/[\W]/`).
- **Object-based counting**: Storing word counts in an object (`wordsCount`), and using dynamic keys to handle the specific word count.

### Summary Notes:
- **`process.argv`** helps capture command-line arguments.
- **Asynchronous file reading** is achieved using `readFile` with `await`.
- **Regular expressions** are used to split content into words.
- **Objects** are used to count word frequencies, and **short-circuit evaluation** (`||`) ensures that a value is initialized to `0` before incrementing.
