
# Detailed Notes on Why `console.log(user.address === address)` Gives `True`

---

When you run the following code:

```javascript
const user = { 
    name: "Sipun Kumar Nanda",
    age: 23,
    address: {
        city: "NYC",
        state: "Odisha"
    },
    hobbies: ["Teaching", "Coding", "IT"]
};

let address = user.address;

console.log(user.address === address);  // Outputs: true
```

The comparison `user.address === address` evaluates to `true`. This happens because of **how object references work in JavaScript**.

---

### 1. **Objects in JavaScript are Reference Types**

- In JavaScript, objects are **reference types**. This means that when you assign an object to a variable, what is actually assigned is a **reference (or pointer)** to the memory location where the object is stored.
- The object itself (its properties and values) lives in memory, and the variable simply holds a reference (or pointer) to that object in memory.

In the example:

```javascript
let address = user.address;
```

Here, the variable `address` is not a **new copy** of `user.address`. Instead, it’s just another **reference** that points to the same memory location as `user.address`.

---

### 2. **Comparing Object References with `===`**

- When you use the `===` operator to compare objects, JavaScript checks whether the two operands point to the **same memory location**.
- If they reference the same object in memory, the comparison will return `true`. If they reference **different** objects, even if those objects have the same structure or values, the comparison will return `false`.

In your case:

```javascript
let address = user.address;
console.log(user.address === address);  // true
```

- Both `user.address` and `address` refer to the **same object** in memory (the `address` object within `user`).
- Since both variables reference the same memory location, the `===` comparison returns `true`.

---

### 3. **Why Is the Output `true`?**

The output is `true` because:

- **No new object is created** when assigning `let address = user.address;`. Instead, `address` becomes a reference to the `user.address` object.
- Both `user.address` and `address` point to the **same object** in memory. Therefore, they are **strictly equal** when compared using `===`.

---

### 4. **Key Concept: Object Equality**

It’s important to note that in JavaScript:

- **Primitive types** (like numbers, strings, booleans) are compared by **value**.
- **Reference types** (like objects and arrays) are compared by **reference**.

This is why when you compare `user.address` and `address`, it checks whether both variables point to the **same object** in memory. Since they do, the comparison returns `true`.

---

### 5. **Example with a New Object: Why It Could Be `false`**

To further illustrate how reference equality works, consider this example:

```javascript
const user = {
  address: {
    city: "NYC",
    state: "Odisha"
  }
};

let newAddress = { city: "NYC", state: "Odisha" };

console.log(user.address === newAddress);  // Outputs: false
```

- Even though `user.address` and `newAddress` have the same **structure** and **values**, they are **different objects** in memory.
- Therefore, the comparison `user.address === newAddress` returns `false` because they are not pointing to the same object in memory.

---

### Summary of Key Points:

- **Objects in JavaScript are compared by reference**, not by value.
- The statement `user.address === address` returns `true` because both `user.address` and `address` are pointing to the **same memory location** (they reference the same object).
- When two objects are **compared with `===`**, JavaScript checks if they are **the same object in memory**, not whether their properties are identical.
- If two variables reference the **same object**, a strict equality check (`===`) will return `true`.

This behavior of object reference is fundamental to understanding how JavaScript handles objects and variables that refer to objects.
