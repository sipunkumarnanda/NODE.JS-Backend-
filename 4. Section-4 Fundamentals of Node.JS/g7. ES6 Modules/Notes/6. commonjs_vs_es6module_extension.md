### **Why CommonJS Does Not Check File Extension (.js) While ES6 Modules (ESM) Strictly Check the Extension**

#### **Introduction**
When working with modules in Node.js, both **CommonJS** and **ES6 modules (ESM)** allow us to import and export code between files. However, one key difference between the two is how they handle file extensions when importing modules.

In **CommonJS** (the traditional module system used in Node.js), it is **not necessary** to specify the file extension when requiring a module, while in **ES6 modules (ESM)**, the file extension **must** be explicitly mentioned when importing a file. This behavior can lead to confusion, especially when transitioning from CommonJS to ES6 modules in Node.js.

### **1. CommonJS Module System**

**CommonJS** is the module system that was originally designed for **server-side** JavaScript (mainly in Node.js). The `require()` function, used in CommonJS, is **not strict about file extensions**. This means that when you require a module, Node.js automatically tries to resolve the module, looking for different file types.

#### **How Node.js Resolves Modules in CommonJS**
When using `require()` in CommonJS, Node.js resolves the path in a few steps:
1. If you provide a relative path (e.g., `require('./myModule')`), Node.js will first look for a file named `myModule.js`.
2. If it doesn't find `myModule.js`, it will check for `myModule.json` or `myModule.node`.
3. If no matching file is found, Node.js throws an error.

Notice that when importing a file, you can **omit the `.js` extension**, and Node.js will still try to resolve the file automatically.

```javascript
// CommonJS Example:
const myModule = require('./myModule');  // .js extension is optional
```

#### **Why is the File Extension Optional in CommonJS?**
CommonJS was created in a time when server-side JavaScript was more flexible and less standardized. The omission of file extensions allows for **ease of use** and **backward compatibility**. Developers do not need to worry about extensions unless the file is in a non-standard format (e.g., `.json`, `.node`, etc.).

### **2. ES6 Modules (ESM)**

In **ES6 modules** (the modern module system in JavaScript), the rules are more strict. The **`import` statement** in ESM requires you to **explicitly include the file extension** when importing a module, even if it is a `.js` file.

#### **Why Does ESM Strictly Require File Extensions?**
The reason ES6 modules require file extensions is part of their design philosophy to **enforce explicitness** and ensure greater **clarity** in module resolution. Unlike CommonJS, which was designed to be flexible and forgiving, ES6 modules were designed to adhere to the **ES module specification (ESM)** that is more standardized and stricter in its approach.

When you use `import` in ESM:
- Node.js will not automatically append `.js` or any other extension.
- You must include the **exact file extension** in your `import` statement.

```javascript
// ES6 Module Example:
import { someFunction } from './myModule.js';  // .js extension is required
```

If you omit the file extension, Node.js will throw an error:
```javascript
// Incorrect import (no extension):
import { someFunction } from './myModule';  // Error: Cannot find module './myModule'
```

#### **Why ES6 Module Enforces the Extension Check?**
1. **Standardization**: ES6 modules were designed to follow a clear and explicit syntax, making module resolution predictable and explicit.
2. **Compatibility with the Browser**: ES6 modules are meant to be used both in the browser and in Node.js. In browsers, JavaScript modules require full paths with extensions to avoid ambiguity.
3. **Explicitness**: By requiring the file extension, developers are forced to be **explicit about their dependencies**, which helps avoid potential issues with module resolution.
4. **Consistency with the ES Module Specification**: The ES6 module system aligns with the official ECMAScript specification, which strictly defines module resolution.

### **3. Key Differences in Module Systems**

| **Feature**                     | **CommonJS**                               | **ES6 Modules (ESM)**                         |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **File Extension Handling**      | Extension (`.js`) is optional. Node.js resolves it automatically. | Extension (`.js`) is **mandatory** when using `import`. |
| **Module Loading**               | Synchronously loads modules using `require()`. | Asynchronously loads modules using `import`. |
| **Syntax**                       | `const module = require('./module')`       | `import module from './module.js'`            |
| **Exporting**                     | `module.exports` or `exports`              | `export` and `export default`                 |
| **Execution Context**            | CommonJS runs code immediately on `require()`. | ES6 modules are always **strict mode** by default. |
| **Module Scope**                 | Each module has its own local scope, and `require` can be used anywhere in the code. | ES6 modules have **module scope** and must be used at the top level. |

### **4. Why the Difference?**

1. **Flexibility in CommonJS**: The **CommonJS** module system is more flexible and forgiving because it was designed for a time when modules were less formalized and there was less emphasis on standardization. It focused on ease of use and speed of development.

2. **Standardization in ES6 Modules**: On the other hand, **ES6 Modules** were created to be part of the JavaScript language specification, making them more **consistent**, **explicit**, and **standardized**. Their strictness regarding file extensions is part of the overall goal to create a more predictable and consistent module system.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

- **CommonJS** does **not require file extensions** because it was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for a quick and easy development process. However, this can sometimes lead to ambiguity or confusion, especially in complex systems.
  
- **ES6 Modules** require file extensions to ensure **clarity** and **standardization**, both in the context of **Node.js** and **browser environments**. This strictness helps avoid potential issues with module resolution and ensures that developers are explicit about the files they are importing.

In Node.js, ES6 modules (with `.mjs` extension or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`) enforce a **clearer, more explicit** approach to importing and exporting files, making the module system more predictable and manageable in larger, more complex applications.
