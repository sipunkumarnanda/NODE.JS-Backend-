### **Why is Strict Mode On by Default in ES6 Modules?**

In JavaScript, **strict mode** is a feature that allows developers to write cleaner, more secure code by enforcing a stricter parsing and error-handling behavior. This mode was introduced in **ECMAScript 5 (ES5)** using the `"use strict"` directive. In **ES6 modules**, strict mode is automatically enabled, and there is no need to explicitly declare it using `"use strict"`. 

This change is important for several reasons related to the behavior, safety, and maintainability of JavaScript code, particularly as it applies to modules.

In this document, we will explore the reasons for enabling **strict mode** by default in **ES6 modules** and how it impacts developers.

---

### **1. What is Strict Mode in JavaScript?**

**Strict mode** is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript that eliminates some of the language's more problematic or error-prone features. When strict mode is enabled, JavaScript performs stricter parsing and error handling, which helps developers avoid common pitfalls.

Strict mode is enabled in two ways:
1. By adding `"use strict";` at the beginning of a script or function in **non-module** code.
2. Automatically in **ES6 modules**, where strict mode is enabled **by default**.

For example:
```javascript
// Strict mode in a non-module script
"use strict";

let x = 10; // Allowed
// x = 20; // SyntaxError: Assignment to constant variable
```

In **ES6 modules**, there is no need to add `"use strict"` because strict mode is enabled automatically.

### **2. Key Features of Strict Mode**

Strict mode introduces several key changes and restrictions compared to non-strict mode:
- **Eliminates `this` coercion**: In non-strict mode, if a function is called without an object context (i.e., as a regular function), `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js). In strict mode, `this` will be `undefined` in such cases, preventing unexpected global variable creation.
  
    ```javascript
    function myFunction() {
      console.log(this);  // In strict mode, `this` will be undefined
    }
    myFunction();  // In non-strict mode, `this` would refer to the global object
    ```

- **Prevents the use of undeclared variables**: In strict mode, trying to assign a value to an undeclared variable will throw an error. This helps catch bugs early.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    x = 10;  // Error: x is not defined
    ```

- **Disallows duplicate property names**: In strict mode, an object cannot have two properties with the same name.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    let obj = { x: 1, x: 2 };  // SyntaxError: Duplicate data property in object literal
    ```

- **Disallows `eval()` assignments**: In strict mode, `eval()` cannot be used to create variables in the local scope.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    eval("var x = 2");  // SyntaxError: Assignment to eval
    ```

- **Disallows `with` statements**: The `with` statement is disallowed in strict mode as it makes code hard to predict.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    with (Math) {  // SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement
      console.log(sqrt(16));
    }
    ```

- **Ensures safer code execution**: Strict mode prevents certain actions that would otherwise silently fail or create unintended side effects.

### **3. Why is Strict Mode On by Default in ES6 Modules?**

#### **A. Ensuring Safer, Cleaner Code**

By enabling strict mode in ES6 modules, JavaScript ensures that **any module** written using this system will follow the **best practices** of modern JavaScript. This significantly reduces the risk of bugs, security issues, and other code-quality problems that arise from poorly managed global state or incorrect variable declarations.

- **Safer Variable Declarations**: Developers must explicitly declare variables using `let`, `const`, or `var`. This reduces the chance of accidentally polluting the global scope with undeclared variables, which is a common source of errors in JavaScript.

- **Eliminates Global Scope Pollution**: With strict mode, there is no ambiguity about the use of the global object (e.g., `window` or `global`). It ensures that accidental assignments to global variables do not occur.

#### **B. Modules Are Isolated by Design**

ES6 modules are designed to be **self-contained** and **isolated** from other code in the application. This isolation helps prevent unintended interference between different parts of the code. Enabling strict mode by default aligns with this design philosophy:
- **Encapsulation**: ES6 modules do not introduce global variables or functions into the global scope unless explicitly exported. This ensures that one module cannot accidentally modify variables or functions in another module.

#### **C. Performance and Error Detection**

Strict mode not only catches more errors during development, but it also helps with performance. JavaScript engines can optimize code execution more efficiently when it knows the rules are strictly followed.

- **Error Detection**: By enforcing stricter rules, strict mode helps developers identify common mistakes such as using undeclared variables, which might otherwise go unnoticed.
- **Improved Performance**: JavaScript engines can optimize the code more effectively when strict mode is enabled because they can rely on more predictable behavior.

#### **D. Encouraging Modern JavaScript Practices**

Since ES6 modules are a modern feature in JavaScript, enabling strict mode by default encourages developers to use **modern JavaScript practices**. This includes:
- Using **`const` and `let`** for variable declarations (avoiding `var`).
- Writing **modular, reusable** code by exporting and importing between modules.
- Avoiding the use of dangerous or deprecated features like `with` and `eval()`.

#### **E. Interoperability and Consistency**

By having strict mode enabled by default, JavaScript modules align with **browser JavaScript** behavior (which also enforces strict mode in modules). This ensures consistency across the platform, whether code is running in Node.js, in the browser, or other JavaScript environments.

### **4. How Does Strict Mode in ES6 Modules Affect Developers?**

- **No More Silent Failures**: Developers are forced to write more disciplined code, as mistakes like using undeclared variables, assigning to read-only properties, or calling methods inappropriately will throw errors instead of failing silently.
  
- **Cleaner Code**: With strict mode, JavaScript code is generally easier to read and maintain, as it reduces ambiguity and improves error detection.

- **Better Debugging**: Strict mode makes it easier to debug issues since it catches common mistakes at compile time, rather than letting them occur silently during runtime.

- **Fewer Security Risks**: By disallowing dangerous features (like `eval()`), strict mode helps reduce security risks that could be introduced by malicious or poorly written code.

### **5. Key Differences Between Strict Mode and Non-Strict Mode**

| **Feature**                            | **Strict Mode (Enabled by Default in ES6 Modules)**        | **Non-Strict Mode**                                      |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Undeclared Variables**               | Throws an error if variables are used without declaration | Allows undeclared variables to be created and implicitly assigned to the global object |
| **`this` in Functions**                | `this` is `undefined` in functions called without context | `this` refers to the global object if called without context |
| **Duplicate Object Properties**        | Throws a syntax error                                     | Allows duplicate object properties                       |
| **Assignment to Read-Only Properties** | Throws an error (e.g., `const` re-assignment)             | Allows assignment to read-only properties               |
| **`with` Statement**                   | Disallowed                                               | Allowed (but considered bad practice)                   |
| **`eval()` Scope**                     | Variables declared in `eval` are not created in the local scope | Variables created inside `eval()` are visible outside the `eval` function |

### **6. Conclusion**

Enabling strict mode by default in ES6 modules provides several advantages:
- It makes JavaScript safer by catching common programming mistakes early.
- It encourages best practices such as using explicit variable declarations and avoiding dangerous features like `eval()` and `with`.
- It enhances performance and debugging, helping developers write more maintainable and secure code.

By enforcing strict mode, Node.js and ES6 modules align with the modern approach to writing JavaScript, providing a consistent, predictable environment for development. As a result, **ES6 modules** have become an essential feature for building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications.
