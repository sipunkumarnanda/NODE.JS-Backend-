### **Library vs CLI Package and Local vs Global Package**

---

#### **1. What is a Library vs CLI Package?**

- **Library Package:**
  - A **library** is a collection of reusable code that provides specific functionality, which can be included in a project as a dependency. It typically doesn't provide an executable command but offers functions, objects, or methods that can be imported into your code and used programmatically.
  - Example: **Lodash** (`lodash`), **Axios** (`axios`), **React** (`react`) are all library packages. These libraries help you perform tasks such as manipulating arrays or handling HTTP requests, but you don’t run them from the command line.

- **CLI (Command Line Interface) Package:**
  - A **CLI package** is a tool or utility that you can run directly from the command line. These packages provide an executable command that you invoke to perform various tasks, such as bundling files, running tests, or creating projects.
  - CLI packages often include a command-line interface that allows you to interact with the package via terminal commands.
  - Example: **Vite** (`vite`), **Webpack** (`webpack`), **ESLint** (`eslint`) are CLI packages. You run them directly from the command line, and they perform tasks like bundling files, linting code, or starting a development server.

#### **2. When We Install a CLI Package, a `.bin` Folder is Created. Why?**

When you install a **CLI package** using `npm`, a `.bin` folder is created in the `node_modules` directory. This folder contains executable files (symlinks) for the commands provided by the CLI package. These executables are the commands you would normally run from the command line.

For example, when you install the **Vite** package (`npm install vite`), the following happens:
- A **symlink** to the `vite` executable is placed in the `.bin` directory inside `node_modules`.
- You can then run `vite` as a command (e.g., `./node_modules/.bin/vite`), but npm allows you to run this command with a simpler invocation, such as `npm run vite`.

**Example of `.bin` folder creation:**

1. When you install the **Vite CLI** package locally with:
   ```bash
   npm install vite
   ```
   - A `node_modules/.bin/vite` file will be created, which points to the Vite executable.

2. You can then run the Vite CLI by running:
   ```bash
   ./node_modules/.bin/vite
   ```

   Alternatively, if you have it defined in your `package.json` script section, you can run:
   ```bash
   npm run vite
   ```

The `.bin` folder is a way to store the executable commands of a package locally within your project, allowing you to run them without installing them globally.

#### **3. Why Do We Store CLI Packages Like Vite in Dev Dependencies?**

CLI packages like **Vite** are typically stored in **devDependencies** because they are used during development and not needed in the production environment. 

- **DevDependencies** are packages that are required for development tasks, such as:
  - Testing, linting, and bundling code.
  - These packages are not required to run the app in a production environment, so they are saved in `devDependencies`.
  
- **Why Vite in `devDependencies`?**
  - **Vite** is a build tool used during development to bundle and serve your project. Once the project is built and ready for production, you don’t need the Vite CLI anymore.
  - Keeping it in `devDependencies` ensures that it’s installed only when you are developing, reducing the size of your production dependencies.

Example:
```bash
npm install --save-dev vite
```

This way, Vite is listed under `devDependencies` in your `package.json`.

#### **4. How to Run a CLI Package?**

You can run a CLI package in two common ways:

1. **By defining it in `package.json` scripts:**

   If the CLI package is installed locally (i.e., as a `devDependency`), you can define the command in the `scripts` section of your `package.json` and run it with `npm run`.

   Example: Running **Vite** locally:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "vite": "vite"
   }
   ```
   You can then run it with:
   ```bash
   npm run vite
   ```

   This is a **standard approach** for local execution because it ensures that the version of the CLI tool you want to run is specified and consistent across different machines or environments.

2. **By using `npx`:**

   **`npx`** allows you to run packages without explicitly installing them globally. It first looks for the package in the local `node_modules/.bin` directory and runs it if available. If it’s not found locally, `npx` will download the package temporarily and run it.

   Example:
   ```bash
   npx vite
   ```

   **Difference between `npm run` and `npx`:**
   - **`npm run`:** Runs a local CLI tool that's defined in your `package.json` scripts, typically installed as a devDependency.
   - **`npx`:** Allows you to run a package from the command line even if it’s not installed locally or globally, as long as it's available in the `PATH`.

   **Why use `npx`?**
   - It's great for running tools without needing to install them globally.
   - It avoids version conflicts by using the locally installed version, or the most recent version available from the registry if not installed.

#### **5. What is a Local Package?**

A **local package** is a package installed within your project’s `node_modules` directory. These packages are only available in the context of that project.

- **Usage:** You typically install local packages as dependencies or devDependencies, depending on whether you need them in production or development.
- **Example:** Running `npm install vite` will install Vite locally in the `node_modules` folder.

When installed locally, you can access the CLI tools (like Vite, Webpack) via `npm run` or `npx`, and these packages are scoped to that project.

---

#### **6. What is a Global Package?**

A **global package** is a package installed globally on your system, making it available to all projects, not just the current project. Global packages are installed outside of the `node_modules` folder, often in directories like `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` (on Unix-like systems) or `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules` (on Windows).

- **Usage:** You install global packages when you want to use the tool across different projects or run commands globally, such as a CLI tool (e.g., `vite`, `webpack`, `eslint`).
- **Example:** Installing **Vite** globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g vite
  ```

Once installed globally, you can run the tool by just typing its name in the terminal (e.g., `vite`), without needing to reference it with `npx` or define it in a `package.json` script.

#### **7. Why Can We Access Global Packages by Just Typing the Package Name, But Not Local Ones?**

- **Global Packages:**
  - When you install a package globally, its executables are placed in a global directory that’s included in your system’s `PATH`. This allows you to run the package just by typing its name (e.g., `vite`) from anywhere in the terminal.

- **Local Packages:**
  - Local packages are only available within the project’s directory. Their executables are stored in the `node_modules/.bin` folder. Therefore, to run them, you must reference them either with `npm run` (using the `scripts` section in `package.json`) or by using `npx`, which automatically looks for the package in the local `node_modules` folder.

- **Why `npx` for Local Packages?**
  - `npx` automatically looks for a local version of the package first, and if not found, it temporarily installs and runs it. This means you don’t need to explicitly install or add the package globally or define it in `package.json` to run it with `npx`.
