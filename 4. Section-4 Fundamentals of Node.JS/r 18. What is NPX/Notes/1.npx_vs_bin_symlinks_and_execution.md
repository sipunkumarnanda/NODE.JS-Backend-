### **Understanding `npx` and `node_modules/.bin/` Folder**

### **What is `npx`?**

- **`npx`** is a command-line tool bundled with npm (since version 5.2.0) that allows you to run Node.js packages and binaries without needing to globally install them.
- `npx` simplifies the execution of commands from packages that are installed locally in a project’s `node_modules` directory, or directly from the npm registry without permanent installation.

### **How `npx` Works**

When you execute a command using `npx`, it follows a set of rules to find and execute the package:

1. **Checks in `package.json` (if present)**:
   - If a `bin` field is defined for the package in `package.json`, `npx` first looks there to resolve the executable.

2. **Checks `node_modules/.bin/` folder**:
   - This folder contains **symlinks (symbolic links)** to the executable files located in the installed packages (e.g., `node_modules/.bin/vite`).
   - If `npx` doesn't find the executable in `package.json`, it looks in `.bin/` for symlinks that point to the actual executable files.

3. **Global Search**:
   - If the executable is not found locally in `node_modules/.bin/` or `package.json`, `npx` will check for a globally installed version of the package (installed with `npm install -g`).

4. **Temporary Installation from npm Registry**:
   - If the package is not found locally or globally, `npx` can temporarily install the package and execute it from the npm registry.

### **Why `npx vite` Works Even After Deleting `.bin` Folder**

#### **1. `npx` Doesn't Always Need `.bin/` Folder**

- **`node_modules/.bin/` Folder**: Normally contains **symlinks** that point to executables inside the installed package directories (e.g., `node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js`). This allows direct execution from the command line.
- However, **`npx` can still run executables directly from the package's directory**, even if the `.bin/` folder is deleted. This is because `npx` resolves the executable by its full path from the installed package.

  - For example, `vite.js` is located at `node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js`. Even without the symlink in `.bin/`, `npx` can directly execute the `vite.js` file by resolving its location in the package directory.

#### **2. `npx` Resolves from the `bin` Field in `package.json`**

- If `vite` is listed in the `dependencies` and its `bin` field is defined in the package, `npx` will use the path to the executable provided by the package's `bin` field to execute it.
- **This means that the `.bin/` symlink is not strictly necessary** for `npx` to find and execute the script; it can fall back on the package's `bin` field or directly execute the script from the package's `node_modules` directory.

#### **3. Symlinks in `.bin/` Are for Convenience**

- **`.bin/` Symlinks**: These symlinks provide easy access to executables, allowing you to run `npx vite` instead of `node_modules/.bin/vite`. However, they are not crucial for `npx` to function.
- Even if you delete the `.bin/` folder, `npx` will still function because it knows how to find the actual executable file in the package directory.

### **Why Custom Code in `.bin/vite` Didn't Execute**

When you modified the `.bin/vite` file by adding a `#!/bin/sh` and an `echo "Hello from Vite"` line, it **didn't work** as expected because:

- **`.bin/vite` is a Symlink, Not an Executable**:
  - The `.bin/vite` file is just a **symlink** (a pointer) to the actual `vite.js` executable located in `node_modules/vite/bin/`. When you modify `.bin/vite`, it doesn't change the behavior of the original executable file that `npx` resolves to.
  - **`npx vite` runs the actual `vite.js` file**, not the `.bin/vite` symlink.
  - Modifying the symlink itself does **not** affect the execution, because `npx` doesn't execute the symlink; it executes the target file defined by the symlink.

---

### **Summary: Why `npx vite` Works Without `.bin/` Folder**

1. **Direct Resolution from Package**: `npx` can resolve the executable directly from the package directory (`node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js`) if `.bin/` is missing.
2. **`npx` Doesn't Rely on `.bin/`**: While `.bin/` provides convenient symlinks, `npx` can run executables directly from their full paths in the package directory.
3. **The Role of Symlinks**: The symlinks in `.bin/` are for convenience, allowing easy access to executables. If deleted, `npx` will still work by directly referencing the executable in the package folder.

### **What You Can Do**

If you want to run custom code instead of the official executable:

1. **Modify the Actual Executable**: Instead of modifying the symlink in `.bin/`, modify the executable (e.g., `vite.js`) inside the package directory (`node_modules/vite/bin/`).
   
2. **Create a Custom Script**: Alternatively, create a new script in `.bin/` that contains your custom logic and then invokes the original executable. For example:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   echo "Hello from custom Vite"
   node ./node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js
   ```

### **Conclusion**

- **`npx` can function without the `.bin/` symlink** because it can directly reference and run executables from the package’s directory, using the package's `bin` field or full path.
- **Symlinks in `.bin/` are not essential** for execution, but they provide a convenient way to access executables.
- When modifying `.bin/vite`, it doesn't execute the code because `.bin/vite` is just a symlink, not the actual executable.
