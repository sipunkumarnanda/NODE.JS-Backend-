### **CLI Project Using `fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile`**

This project demonstrates how to read the contents of a file and then write those contents to another file (in this case, a file on the desktop). It includes examples of using text data and binary data (via a buffer).

---

### **Code Explanation**

#### **Code:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises';

// Reading a file as a string (text content)
const data = await fs.readFile('./file-1.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(data); // Logs the text content of 'file-1.txt'

// Writing the text content to a file on the desktop
await fs.writeFile("C:/Users/Sipun Kumar Nanda/OneDrive/Desktop/file-1.txt", data);

// Using Windows-style paths with double backslashes
await fs.writeFile("C:\\Users\\Sipun Kumar Nanda\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\file-1.txt", data);

// Reading a file as a buffer (binary content)
const contentBuffer = await fs.readFile('./file-1.txt');
console.log(contentBuffer); // Logs the buffer representation of the file

// Writing the binary content to a file on the desktop
await fs.writeFile("C:\\Users\\Sipun Kumar Nanda\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\file-1.txt", contentBuffer);
```

### **Detailed Explanation of Each Step**

#### **1. Reading a File as a String**
```javascript
const data = await fs.readFile('./file-1.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(data);
```

- **`fs.readFile(path, encoding)`**:
  - **`path`**: The relative or absolute path to the file you want to read.
  - **`encoding`**: The character encoding (e.g., `'utf-8'`). Specifying this tells Node.js to interpret the file content as a string.

- **`await`** ensures that the operation completes before moving to the next line. The returned `data` will be a string.

- **Example Output:**
  If `file-1.txt` contains:
  ```
  Hello, Node.js!
  ```
  The `console.log(data)` will output:
  ```
  Hello, Node.js!
  ```

#### **2. Writing Text Content to a File**
```javascript
await fs.writeFile("C:/Users/Sipun Kumar Nanda/OneDrive/Desktop/file-1.txt", data);
```

- **`fs.writeFile(path, content)`**:
  - **`path`**: The location where the file will be written.
  - **`content`**: The data to write. It can be a string or buffer.

- **Path Styles**:
  - Forward slashes (`/`): **`C:/Users/Sipun Kumar Nanda/...`**
  - Double backslashes (`\\`): **`C:\\Users\\Sipun Kumar Nanda\\...`**

- If the file doesn’t exist, it is created automatically. If the file exists, its content is overwritten.

#### **3. Reading a File as a Buffer**
```javascript
const contentBuffer = await fs.readFile('./file-1.txt');
console.log(contentBuffer);
```

- When you don’t specify an encoding, **`fs.readFile()`** returns the file content as a **buffer** (binary data).

- **Buffer**: A buffer is a temporary storage area for binary data. It is often used when working with non-text files like images or videos.

- **Example Output:**
  For the same content (`Hello, Node.js!`), `console.log(contentBuffer)` outputs:
  ```
  <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 4e 6f 64 65 2e 6a 73 21>
  ```
  Each pair (e.g., `48`) represents a hexadecimal value of a character in the file.

#### **4. Writing Binary Content to a File**
```javascript
await fs.writeFile("C:\\Users\\Sipun Kumar Nanda\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\file-1.txt", contentBuffer);
```

- Here, the content written is a buffer instead of a string.
- The file created will be identical to the original file, preserving its format and encoding.

### **Common Use Cases**

1. **Text Files**:
   - Read and modify `.txt` or `.csv` files.
   - Use the `utf-8` encoding to interpret the file as text.

2. **Binary Files**:
   - Handle image files (`.png`, `.jpg`), videos, or any non-text files.
   - Work directly with buffer data to ensure the file’s binary structure is preserved.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**

1. **Encoding Matters**:
   - Specify `'utf-8'` for text files.
   - Omit the encoding for binary files to read/write as a buffer.

2. **Path Styles**:
   - Use `/` or `\\` for file paths.
   - **Best Practice**: Use forward slashes (`/`) for better cross-platform compatibility.

3. **Overwrite Behavior**:
   - **`fs.writeFile()`** overwrites existing files by default. Be cautious or use `fs.appendFile()` to add content instead.

4. **Buffer Usage**:
   - Buffers are essential for binary file operations.
   - Always use a buffer when reading/writing files that are not plain text.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Always wrap `fs` operations in a `try-catch` block to handle errors like missing files or permission issues.

### **Conclusion**

This project provides a simple yet powerful demonstration of file handling in Node.js. By understanding how to use `fs.readFile()` and `fs.writeFile()`, you can manipulate text and binary files effectively.
