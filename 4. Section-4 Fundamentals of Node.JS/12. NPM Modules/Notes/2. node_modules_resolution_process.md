### Question: Why does `require('maths')` work fine even though there is a `mate.js` file inside the `node_modules` folder?

When you use `const num = require('maths')` and it works fine despite the `maths.js` file being inside the `node_modules` folder, here's what is happening behind the scenes in Node.js:

### **Explanation:**

1. **Node.js Module Resolution Algorithm:**
   - When you use `require()` to import a module, Node.js follows a module resolution algorithm to find and load the module.
   - The first place Node.js looks is in the **`node_modules`** folder, which is the default directory for third-party packages installed via NPM.
   
2. **How Node.js Resolves the Module:**
   - When you call `require('maths')`, Node.js will attempt to find a package or module named `maths` in the following order:
     1. **Local File or Directory**: If `maths` is a local file (relative path like `./maths.js`), it will look in the current directory for `maths.js`. If not found, it moves to the next step.
     2. **`node_modules` Folder**: If no local file is found, Node.js checks if there is a `node_modules` folder in the current directory or any parent directories. If `maths` is a package or module inside the `node_modules` folder, it will load the corresponding module. In your case, it finds `maths` inside the `node_modules` folder and loads it.
   
3. **If `maths` is a Custom Module**: 
   - If you have installed a package or module named `maths` via NPM or if it is a custom module that you or someone else created, and it exists in the `node_modules` folder, Node.js will automatically load it without needing to specify the file path.
   - For example, if you run `npm install maths` or the module is already in your `node_modules`, Node.js will find the corresponding file inside the `node_modules/maths` folder.

4. **Common Use Case with Packages**:
   - If `maths` is a third-party package installed using NPM (like `maths` from the NPM registry), Node.js will look for a `main` file in the `package.json` of the `maths` package, and use that as the entry point. Typically, this would be a `maths.js` or `index.js` file within the package directory.

### **File Structure Example:**

```plaintext
my_project/
│
├── node_modules/
│   ├── maths/
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── maths.js
├── app.js
└── package.json
```

In this example:
- You run `require('maths')` in `app.js`.
- Node.js checks the `node_modules` folder for a directory named `maths`.
- If it finds it, Node.js loads the file defined in the `main` property of `package.json` (e.g., `maths.js` or `index.js`).
- If there's no `package.json`, Node.js defaults to loading `maths.js`.

### **Why Does This Work?**
- **`node_modules`** is where NPM packages are stored, and Node.js is smart enough to look in this folder for any packages you require without needing the full path.
- If `maths` is a local module or a third-party module installed via NPM, Node.js resolves it to the appropriate file in `node_modules`.

### **Package.json Example:**
If `maths` is a third-party module, it might have a `package.json` like this:

```json
{
  "name": "maths",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "maths.js"
}
```

Here, the `main` property indicates which file to load when the package is required.

### **Conclusion:**
- The reason `require('maths')` works in your case is because Node.js is resolving `maths` as a module/package from the `node_modules` directory.
- You don't need to specify the file path (like `./maths.js`) if it's already installed in `node_modules`. Node.js automatically knows where to look.
