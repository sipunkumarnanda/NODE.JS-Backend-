### Error : 'hello' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

### **Problem Explanation**

#### **1. Understanding the Context**
- You created a `hello` script inside the `.bin` folder in `node_modules`.  
- The `hello` script contained a simple shell command:
  ```sh
  echo "I am Hello"
  ```
- Then, you tried to execute the script using `npx hello`.

#### **2. Default Shell Behavior on Windows**
- By default, **Windows** uses either **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** or **PowerShell** as its shell.
- The script `hello` relies on shell commands (`echo` in this case) and expects to be executed in a Unix-like environment.
- **Windows' default shell (cmd.exe)**:
  - Does not understand Unix-style shell syntax or behavior.
  - Lacks support for many Unix commands.

#### **3. Why the Error Occurred**
- When you ran `npx hello`, `npx` tried to execute the `hello` script.
- Since npm and `npx` use the default Windows shell (`cmd.exe`) to execute scripts unless otherwise configured, the execution failed with the error:
  ```
  'hello' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
  ```
- This error occurred because:
  - The `hello` script was interpreted as a command.
  - `cmd.exe` or PowerShell did not recognize it as an executable script or a valid command.

### **How the Problem Was Solved**

You ran the following script to fix the issue:
```sh
npm config set script-shell "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash"
```

#### **What This Script Does**
1. **Changes npm's Default Shell**:
   - By running this command, you explicitly told npm (and `npx`) to use the **Bash shell** located at:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash
     ```
   - This Bash shell is provided by **Git for Windows** (commonly installed for Git workflows).

2. **Why Bash Works**:
   - Bash is a Unix-like shell that supports the syntax and commands expected by your `hello` script.
   - When `npx hello` runs, the Bash shell interprets the script correctly and executes the `echo` command.

#### **Impact of the Script**
- After setting `script-shell`, npm uses Bash instead of `cmd.exe` to execute all scripts.
- Now, when you run `npx hello`:
  - Bash interprets the `hello` script.
  - The `echo` command is executed, and you see:
    ```
    I am Hello
    ```

### **Detailed Notes**

#### **1. Shebangs vs Shell Configuration**
- A **shebang** (e.g., `#!/bin/sh`) is not present in your `hello` script, so the operating system relies entirely on the shell environment to execute it.
- By default:
  - On Unix systems, `/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash` is used.
  - On Windows, `cmd.exe` or PowerShell is used unless overridden.
- Overriding the shell with Bash ensures Unix-style compatibility.

#### **2. How `npx` Works with the `.bin` Folder**
- `npx` looks for executables in the `.bin` folder of `node_modules`.
- It uses npm's `script-shell` configuration to determine which shell to use for execution.
- When the shell is incompatible (like `cmd.exe` for Unix-style scripts), errors occur.

#### **3. Git Bash for Windows**
- Git Bash is a Bash emulator provided by Git for Windows.
- It provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, making it possible to execute Unix shell scripts seamlessly.

### **Key Takeaways**

#### **Why the Problem Occurred**
- Windows' default shell (`cmd.exe`) cannot handle Unix-style scripts or commands.
- `npx` relies on npm's default shell configuration, which was set to `cmd.exe` or PowerShell.

#### **Why the Solution Worked**
- Setting the `script-shell` to Git Bash provided a Unix-compatible shell.
- Bash can interpret and execute Unix-style scripts and commands.

#### **When to Use This Solution**
- If you frequently work with Unix-style shell scripts on Windows, configuring npm to use Git Bash is a common and effective solution.
- This ensures compatibility with cross-platform scripts.

#### **Additional Notes**
- If Git Bash is not installed, you can download it as part of the **Git for Windows** package.
- To reset the shell configuration to default, you can run:
  ```sh
  npm config delete script-shell
  ```

### **Conclusion**

The issue was resolved because you explicitly instructed npm to use Git Bash (`bash`) as its shell instead of the default Windows shell (`cmd.exe`). This provided the necessary Unix-like environment to execute your `hello` script successfully.
