### **Renaming and Moving Files or Directories with `fs.rename()`**

The `fs.rename()` method in Node.js serves a dual purpose:
1. **Renaming a File or Folder**: Changes the name of a file or directory in the same location.
2. **Moving a File or Folder**: Relocates a file or directory to a new path, effectively renaming it.

#### **Syntax of `fs.rename()`**
```javascript
await fs.rename(oldPath, newPath);
```

- `oldPath`: The current path of the file or folder.
- `newPath`: The desired path and name for the file or folder.

#### **Example 1: Renaming a File**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises';

try {
    // Rename 'oldFile.txt' to 'newFile.txt'
    await fs.rename('./oldFile.txt', './newFile.txt');
    console.log("File renamed successfully!");
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error renaming file:", error);
}
```

#### **Example 2: Moving a File**
```javascript
try {
    // Move 'example.txt' from the current directory to the desktop
    await fs.rename('./example.txt', 'C:\\Users\\YourName\\Desktop\\example.txt');
    console.log("File moved successfully!");
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error moving file:", error);
}
```

---

#### **Example 3: Renaming and Moving a Folder**
```javascript
try {
    // Move the folder 'myFolder' to a new location and rename it to 'newFolder'
    await fs.rename('./myFolder', 'C:\\Users\\YourName\\Desktop\\newFolder');
    console.log("Folder moved and renamed successfully!");
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error renaming/moving folder:", error);
}
```

---

#### **Key Points**
1. **Rename and Move Together**: 
   - If the `newPath` specifies a different directory, the method effectively moves the file or folder.
   - If the `newPath` specifies the same directory but a different name, it renames the file or folder.

2. **Cross-Drive Operations**:
   - `fs.rename()` cannot move files between different drives or partitions. Use `fs.copyFile()` followed by `fs.unlink()` in such cases.

---

#### **Example 4: Handle Cross-Drive Moves**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises';

async function moveFileCrossDrive(src, dest) {
    try {
        // Copy the file to the new location
        await fs.copyFile(src, dest);
        console.log("File copied successfully!");

        // Delete the original file
        await fs.unlink(src);
        console.log("Original file deleted!");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error moving file across drives:", error);
    }
}

// Move file from D: to C: drive
await moveFileCrossDrive('D:\\example.txt', 'C:\\Users\\YourName\\Desktop\\example.txt');
```

### **Advantages of Using `fs.rename()`**
1. **Efficiency**: For operations within the same drive, `fs.rename()` is faster as it only updates the file's metadata.
2. **Simplicity**: One method to rename and move files, reducing code complexity.
