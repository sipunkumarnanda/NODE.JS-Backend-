### **1. `which` Command**

#### **Purpose:**
The `which` command is used to locate the path of an executable program. It checks the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable and returns the path of the executable file that would have been executed if the program name had been entered at the command prompt.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash
which [command]
```

- **`command`**: The name of the command or program you want to locate.

#### **Example Usage:**

1. **Find the Path of Node.js:**

   ```bash
   which node
   ```

   **Output Example:**
   ```bash
   /usr/bin/node
   ```

   - This means that the `node` executable is located at `/usr/bin/node` on your system.

2. **Find the Path of a Command:**

   ```bash
   which python
   ```

   **Output Example:**
   ```bash
   /usr/bin/python3
   ```

#### **How It Works:**
- The `which` command looks for the executable file by searching all directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.
- It returns the first match it finds.
- If no executable is found, it returns no output.

#### **Why Use `which`?**

- **To find the location of a command** when you want to know where it's installed or which version of it will be executed.
- **To troubleshoot issues** with different versions of tools that might exist in multiple directories.

### **2. `type` Command**

#### **Purpose:**
The `type` command in Bash is used to describe how a command would be interpreted if executed. It shows whether a command is an alias, a keyword, a shell built-in, or a program. It can also tell you the path of an executable program.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash
type [command]
```

- **`command`**: The name of the command or program you want to investigate.

#### **Example Usage:**

1. **Check What `node` Is:**

   ```bash
   type node
   ```

   **Output Example:**
   ```bash
   node is /usr/bin/node
   ```

   - This shows that `node` is an executable program located at `/usr/bin/node`.

2. **Check for Aliases or Built-in Commands:**

   ```bash
   type ls
   ```

   **Output Example:**
   ```bash
   ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto`
   ```

   - This shows that `ls` is an alias with the option `--color=auto`.

3. **Check for Shell Built-ins:**

   ```bash
   type echo
   ```

   **Output Example:**
   ```bash
   echo is a shell builtin
   ```

   - This tells you that `echo` is a shell built-in command, not an external program.

#### **How It Works:**
- The `type` command checks if the given command is a shell built-in, an alias, a function, or an external program.
- If it's an external program, `type` also shows its location (like `which` does).
- If it's a shell built-in or alias, `type` provides that information instead of a path.

#### **Why Use `type`?**

- **To understand whether a command is a shell built-in or an external program.**
- **To check if a command is an alias or a function** that overrides a standard command.
- **To get more detailed information** than what `which` provides, such as identifying if the command is a built-in or an alias.

### **Key Differences Between `which` and `type`:**

| Feature            | `which`                                      | `type`                                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Locates the path of an executable program.   | Describes how a command is interpreted (e.g., whether it's a built-in, alias, or executable). |
| **Output**         | Only the path to the executable.             | Describes the type of command (e.g., built-in, alias, executable) and its path if applicable. |
| **Use Case**       | Finding where a program is located.          | Understanding how a command is interpreted (e.g., checking for aliases or built-ins). |
| **Example**        | `which node` → `/usr/bin/node`               | `type ls` → `ls is aliased to 'ls --color=auto'` |

### **Conclusion:**

- Use **`which`** when you simply need to find the path of an executable command.
- Use **`type`** when you need more detailed information about a command, such as whether it's an alias, a built-in command, or an external executable.
