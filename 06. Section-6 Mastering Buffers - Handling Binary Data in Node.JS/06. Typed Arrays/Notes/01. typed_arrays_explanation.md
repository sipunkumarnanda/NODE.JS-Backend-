### **Topic Name: Typed Arrays**

#### **Q1. What is TypedArray, Why Do We Use It, and Why Don’t We Have Much Control Over It?**

#### **What is a TypedArray?**
A **TypedArray** is a special object in JavaScript designed to handle binary data efficiently. Unlike regular arrays, which can store mixed data types, a TypedArray stores data of a single type in a fixed-size, contiguous memory block.

#### **Key Features of TypedArrays:**
1. **Fixed Size**: Once created, the size of a TypedArray cannot be changed.  
2. **Typed Storage**: All elements in a TypedArray must be of the same type (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit integers, or floating-point numbers).  
3. **Backed by ArrayBuffer**: Every TypedArray is backed by an **ArrayBuffer** which represents the raw binary data.  
4. **Performance-Oriented**: Accessing and manipulating TypedArrays is faster than regular arrays because they directly work with binary memory.

#### **Why Do We Use TypedArrays?**

1. **Binary Data Manipulation**: TypedArrays allow developers to read, write, and manipulate binary data in formats like files, network streams, or graphics data.  
2. **Web APIs**: Many web APIs like **WebGL**, **Canvas**, or **FileReader** require TypedArrays to work with binary data.  
3. **Performance**: TypedArrays are optimized for numeric computations and work faster than regular arrays in such cases.  
4. **Interoperability**: TypedArrays are essential when working with binary formats like images, audio, or custom protocols.

#### **Why Don’t We Have Much Control Over TypedArrays?**

1. **Fixed Memory Layout**:
   - A TypedArray is tightly coupled with an **ArrayBuffer** and directly maps to its memory layout.  
   - You cannot modify its size or data type once initialized. For example, a `Uint8Array` cannot be changed into a `Float32Array` without creating a new TypedArray.

2. **Limited Flexibility**:
   - TypedArrays operate on strict memory alignment. A `Uint16Array` always reads/writes data in 2-byte chunks, while a `Uint8Array` operates on 1-byte chunks.  
   - To access or modify data in a different format (e.g., treating bytes as floats), you need to create a new TypedArray or use a **DataView**.

3. **Lack of Endianness Control**:
   - TypedArrays work in the system’s native **endianness** (usually **little-endian**).  
   - Unlike a **DataView**, you cannot explicitly control how multi-byte values are stored or read (big-endian vs. little-endian).  

4. **No Built-In Bound Checking**:
   - TypedArrays do not throw errors if you access an out-of-bounds index; instead, they return `undefined`.

5. **Focused on Efficiency**:
   - TypedArrays prioritize speed and efficiency over flexibility. They bypass many JavaScript features (e.g., dynamic resizing, mixed data types) to provide low-level memory access.

---

#### **Summary:**
- **TypedArrays** are a powerful tool for working with binary data efficiently.  
- They are less flexible than regular arrays because they prioritize performance and strict memory layout.  
- For more control, such as custom memory alignment or handling mixed data types, **DataView** is a better choice.
