### Notes: Practical Demonstration of Buffers in File Operations and Networking

This example demonstrates the use of buffers in both networking and file operations. Here's how everything works in detail:

---

### **1. Server-Side Code (server.js)**
#### **Dependencies**
- `http`: Used to create an HTTP server.
- `fs/promises`: Provides asynchronous file operations like reading and writing.

#### **Code Breakdown**
```javascript
import http from "http";
import fs from "fs/promises";

// Create the HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Handle incoming data from the client (POST request body)
  req.on("data", (reqBody) => {
    console.log(reqBody); // Logs the received buffer.
    console.log(reqBody.toString()); // Converts the buffer to a string and logs it.

    // Write the received data into a file named 'text.txt'.
    fs.writeFile("text.txt", reqBody);
  });

  // Set response headers
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/txt; charset=utf-8");
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");

  // End the response
  res.end("Hello from server");
});

// Start the server and listen on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Listening on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

#### **Key Features**
1. **Receiving Data**: 
   - The `req.on("data")` event captures the body of a POST request sent by the client.
   - Data is received as a buffer.
2. **Writing to a File**:
   - The buffer is directly written to a file (`text.txt`) using `fs.writeFile`.

---

### **2. Client-Side Code (app.js)**
The client sends data to the server using the `fetch` API. Two examples are shown: sending a string and sending an ArrayBuffer.

#### **Sending a String**
```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:3000", {
  method: "POST",
  body: "Sipun Kumar Nanda", // Sending string data
})
  .then((res) => res.text())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data); // Logs server's response
  });
```

- **Body Content**: `"Sipun Kumar Nanda"` is sent as the request body. 
- **Buffer on Server**: On the server, this string is automatically converted to a buffer.
- **File Content**: The string is written into `text.txt`.

#### **Sending an ArrayBuffer**
```javascript
const a = new ArrayBuffer(4);
const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(a);

uint8Array[0] = 97; // ASCII 'a'
uint8Array[1] = 98; // ASCII 'b'
uint8Array[2] = 99; // ASCII 'c'
uint8Array[3] = 104; // ASCII 'h'

fetch("http://localhost:3000", {
  method: "POST",
  body: a, // Sending ArrayBuffer
})
  .then((res) => res.text())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data); // Logs server's response
  });
```

- **Body Content**: The `ArrayBuffer` is sent as the request body.
  - It contains the ASCII values for `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, and `'h'`.
- **Buffer on Server**: The server receives this binary data as a buffer.
- **File Content**: The binary data is written directly into `text.txt`.

### **3. File Structure**
```
project/
│
├── server/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── package.json
│
├── JS/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── app.js
```

---

### **4. How It Works Together**
1. **Running the Server**:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory.
   - Run the server with `npm run dev` or `npm start` (depending on your script).
   - The server starts listening on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Client-Side Operations**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in the browser.
   - The `app.js` script sends requests to the server.
   - Depending on the example:
     - A string or binary data (ArrayBuffer) is sent to the server.
     - The server processes the data, logs it, and writes it to `text.txt`.

3. **Validation**:
   - Check the server console for logged buffers and their string representations.
   - Open the `text.txt` file to confirm the written content.

### **Key Learnings**
1. **Networking Buffers**:
   - Buffers are used to handle incoming or outgoing data in networking.
   - Data like strings or binary formats (e.g., images, files) are transmitted as buffers.

2. **File Operations**:
   - Buffers are used to read and write data to files efficiently.
   - This is crucial for handling non-text data like images or videos.

3. **Practical Flow**:
   - The client sends data to the server using `fetch`.
   - The server processes the data, which is initially received as a buffer.
   - The processed data is written to a file for storage or further use.

When you refresh the HTML page, the client-side script (`app.js`) runs again, triggering a new **POST** request to the server. Each time the server receives a **POST** request, it writes the received data to `text.txt` in the server folder. Here’s why a new file is created or updated every time:

---

### **Explanation**
1. **HTML Page Reload**:
   - Reloading the page in the browser re-executes the `<script>` tag in your `index.html`.
   - This runs the JavaScript code in `app.js`, which sends a new request to the server.

2. **Client-Side `fetch`**:
   - The `fetch` function in `app.js` sends a **POST** request with the specified body data (string or binary).
   - This happens every time the script is executed.

3. **Server-Side Handling**:
   - The server receives the **POST** request and processes the request body using `req.on('data')`.
   - The buffer data is captured and written to a file named `text.txt` using `fs.writeFile`.

4. **File Creation or Overwriting**:
   - If the file `text.txt` does not exist, it is created.
   - If `text.txt` already exists, `fs.writeFile` overwrites its content with the new data received from the client.

---

### **Result**
Each time you refresh the page:
1. A new request is sent to the server.
2. The server processes the data and overwrites or creates `text.txt` with the received content.

---

### **Suggestions to Avoid Overwriting**
If you want to **append** data to the file instead of overwriting it, you can use `fs.appendFile` instead of `fs.writeFile` in `server.js`:

```javascript
fs.appendFile("text.txt", reqBody + "\n");
```

- This will add the new data to the end of `text.txt` each time a request is received, separated by a newline.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
Refreshing the page triggers the client-side `fetch` request, which in turn causes the server to process the data and create or update a file in the server folder.
