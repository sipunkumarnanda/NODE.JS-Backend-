### Understanding UTF-16LE and UTF-8 Behavior in `Buffer.toString()`

If you're observing that a string written in `utf-16le` appears **correctly decoded** when read using `utf-8`, this is a result of **misinterpretation or coincidence**. Let’s break it down and explain why this happens.

### **Key Points About UTF-16LE and UTF-8**
1. **UTF-16LE**: Encodes each character into 2 bytes (16 bits) in **little-endian format**. For example:
   - `"H"` (U+0048) → `0x48 0x00` (least significant byte first).
   - `"e"` (U+0065) → `0x65 0x00`.

2. **UTF-8**: Encodes characters into 1 to 4 bytes, depending on the Unicode code point. ASCII characters (`U+0000` to `U+007F`) are encoded in 1 byte, making UTF-8 backward-compatible with ASCII.

### **What Happens in Your Code?**

1. **Buffer Creation Using UTF-16LE**:
   ```javascript
   const nodeBuffer2 = Buffer.from("Hello World Boyz", "utf-16le");
   ```
   This creates a buffer with raw bytes as follows (in hexadecimal):
   ```
   48 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F 00 20 00 57 00 6F 00 72 00 6C 00 64 00 20 00 42 00 6F 00 79 00 7A 00
   ```

2. **Reading the Buffer as UTF-8**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(nodeBuffer2.toString('utf-8'));
   ```
   When interpreting the UTF-16LE buffer as UTF-8:
   - UTF-8 tries to decode each byte (or sequence of bytes) according to its rules.
   - In this case, ASCII-compatible bytes (`0x48`, `0x65`, etc.) are interpreted as valid characters, while null bytes (`0x00`) are treated as **null characters (`U+0000`)**.

---

### **Why Does It Appear "Correct"?**
The illusion of "correct decoding" happens because the string is ASCII-compatible:
- ASCII characters are encoded as single bytes (`0x48` for `H`, `0x65` for `e`), and UTF-8 can correctly interpret them.
- The null bytes (`0x00`) are ignored in most textual output because they represent the Unicode null character (`U+0000`), which is invisible.

**For Example**: 
- UTF-16LE encoding of `"Hello"`:
  ```
  48 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F 00
  ```
- UTF-8 interpretation:
  - `0x48` → `H`
  - `0x00` → null (invisible)
  - `0x65` → `e`
  - `0x00` → null (invisible)
  - `0x6C` → `l`
  - `0x00` → null (invisible)
  - `0x6C` → `l`
  - `0x00` → null (invisible)
  - `0x6F` → `o`
  - `0x00` → null (invisible)

**Output**: `"Hello"` appears correct because the null characters are invisible.

### **When This Will Fail**
This behavior breaks if the string contains non-ASCII characters. For example:
```javascript
const buffer = Buffer.from("Héllo", "utf-16le");
console.log(buffer.toString('utf-8'));
```
Here:
- `é` (U+00E9) in UTF-16LE → `0xE9 0x00`.
- `0xE9` is **not valid in UTF-8 as a standalone byte**, so the decoding fails, resulting in corrupted or garbled output.

---

### **Key Observations**
1. **UTF-8 Handles Null Bytes**: In UTF-8, `0x00` represents the null character (`U+0000`), which is valid but typically invisible in text output.
2. **UTF-16LE Includes Null Bytes**: ASCII characters are padded with `0x00` in UTF-16LE (`H` → `0x48 0x00`), creating the illusion that UTF-8 decoding "skips" them.
3. **Encoding Mismatch**: Reading a UTF-16LE buffer as UTF-8 only works for ASCII characters and results in corrupted output for non-ASCII characters.

---

### **Proper Handling**
To correctly read a UTF-16LE-encoded buffer, you must decode it with the same encoding:
```javascript
const buffer = Buffer.from("Hello World Boyz", "utf-16le");
console.log(buffer.toString('utf-16le')); // Correctly reads: "Hello World Boyz"
```

---

### **Summary**
1. The `Buffer.toString()` method does **not skip `0x00` bytes**. It interprets the bytes based on the specified encoding.
2. The appearance of "correct" results when reading UTF-16LE as UTF-8 is due to ASCII compatibility and the invisibility of null characters in output.
3. Always ensure that the encoding used for reading matches the encoding used for writing to avoid data corruption.
