### **Difference Between `Uint8Array.toString()` and `Buffer.toString()` in Node.js**

When dealing with `Uint8Array` and `Buffer` in Node.js, their `toString()` methods behave very differently because they are designed for distinct use cases.

---

### **1. `Uint8Array.toString()`**

#### **What it does**  
- The `toString()` method of `Uint8Array` is inherited from JavaScript's `Object` prototype.
- It returns a string that represents the object, not its content. By default, this string is `[object Uint8Array]`.

#### **Why does it not decode the data?**
- `Uint8Array` is a generic typed array, and its `toString()` method isn't designed to interpret or decode binary data into human-readable formats like text.
- To view its data as a string, you need to explicitly convert it (e.g., using `TextDecoder` or `String.fromCharCode`).

#### **Example**
```javascript
const uint8Array = new Uint8Array([97, 98, 99, 100]); // ASCII codes for 'abcd'
console.log(uint8Array.toString()); // "97,98,99,100" (default numeric representation of its values)
```

### **2. `Buffer.toString()`**

#### **What it does**  
- The `toString()` method of a Node.js `Buffer` interprets the binary data stored in the buffer as a string.  
- By default, it uses UTF-8 encoding to decode the binary data into human-readable text.

#### **Why does it decode data into text?**
- `Buffer` is specifically designed for handling binary data and converting it to/from text or other formats. It provides built-in support for encoding schemes like UTF-8, ASCII, and Base64.

#### **Example**
```javascript
const buffer = Buffer.from([97, 98, 99, 100]); // ASCII codes for 'abcd'
console.log(buffer.toString()); // "abcd" (decoded from UTF-8 by default)
```

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**            | **`Uint8Array.toString()`**             | **`Buffer.toString()`**                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Generic representation of the array's data. | Decodes binary data into a string using an encoding scheme (e.g., UTF-8). |
| **Output**             | A string of comma-separated numeric values. | Decoded string content (e.g., "abcd").  |
| **Use Case**           | Primarily used for raw numerical data.  | Text-based operations on binary data.   |
| **Customization**      | No direct way to decode binary data.    | Supports encoding (e.g., `buffer.toString('hex')`). |

### **How to Convert `Uint8Array` to a Decoded String**
To decode a `Uint8Array` into a string, you can use the `TextDecoder` API:

```javascript
const uint8Array = new Uint8Array([97, 98, 99, 100]); // 'abcd' in ASCII
const decoder = new TextDecoder('utf-8'); // Create a UTF-8 decoder
console.log(decoder.decode(uint8Array)); // "abcd"
```

---

### **Summary**

1. **`Uint8Array.toString()`**: Converts the numeric contents of the array into a comma-separated string (e.g., `"97,98,99,100"`). It doesn't decode data into human-readable text. Use `TextDecoder` for decoding.
2. **`Buffer.toString()`**: Decodes the binary content of the buffer into a human-readable string using UTF-8 or other encoding schemes. This is specific to Node.js and is suitable for text-based operations.

### **Why They Work Differently?**
- `Uint8Array` is part of the JavaScript `TypedArray` specification, which doesn't assume any particular encoding or format for binary data.
- `Buffer` is a Node.js-specific implementation, optimized for handling binary data with text encoding/decoding as a first-class feature.
