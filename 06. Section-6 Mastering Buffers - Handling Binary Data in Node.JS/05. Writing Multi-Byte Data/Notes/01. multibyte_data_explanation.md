### What is Multibyte Data?

**Multibyte data** refers to data types that require more than a single byte (8 bits) to represent their values. This is typically used for representing larger numeric values or more complex data structures. While an 8-bit integer (`Int8` or `Uint8`) can store values in the range of -128 to 127 or 0 to 255, larger ranges require additional bytes.

### Common Multibyte Data Types
Here are some common multibyte data types and their sizes:
- **16-bit integers**: Require 2 bytes (e.g., `Int16`, `Uint16`).
- **32-bit integers**: Require 4 bytes (e.g., `Int32`, `Uint32`).
- **64-bit floating-point numbers**: Require 8 bytes (e.g., `Float64`).

### Why Use Multibyte Data?
Multibyte data types are necessary when:
1. **Larger Ranges**: The value to be stored exceeds the range of 1-byte data types.
2. **Precision**: Floating-point numbers or other formats need multiple bytes to ensure accuracy.
3. **Efficiency**: Storing and manipulating data using fewer variables by increasing the size of each variable.

### How Multibyte Data is Stored in Memory
When multibyte data is stored, its byte order must be considered:
1. **Big-endian**:
   - The most significant byte (MSB) is stored first (at the lowest memory address).
   - Example for `Int16` value 260 (binary: `00000001 00000100`):
     - Memory: `[01, 04]`.

2. **Little-endian**:
   - The least significant byte (LSB) is stored first.
   - Example for `Int16` value 260:
     - Memory: `[04, 01]`.

The byte order affects how the data is read and interpreted.

### Key Characteristics of Multibyte Data
1. **Byte Length**:
   - The size of the data is fixed (e.g., 2 bytes for `Int16`, 4 bytes for `Int32`).
2. **Alignment**:
   - Multibyte data is often aligned to specific byte boundaries to optimize access speed.
3. **Endianess**:
   - The ordering of bytes is crucial when reading or writing multibyte data.

### Example: Multibyte Data in JavaScript with ArrayBuffer and DataView
```javascript
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(4); // Create a buffer of 4 bytes
const view = new DataView(buffer);

// Write 16-bit integer in Big-endian order
view.setInt16(0, 260); // Stored as [01, 04]
console.log(view.getInt16(0)); // Reads as 260

// Write 16-bit integer in Little-endian order
view.setInt16(2, 260, true); // Stored as [04, 01]
console.log(view.getInt16(2, true)); // Reads as 260

// Read as Big-endian when written in Little-endian
console.log(view.getInt16(2)); // Output will differ due to reversed byte order
```

### Applications of Multibyte Data
- **Networking**: Multibyte data formats are commonly used for network communication protocols, where endianess plays a critical role.
- **File Formats**: File formats like PNG, JPEG, and MP4 rely on multibyte data to store complex information.
- **Graphics Programming**: Handling color values (RGBA) or 3D object coordinates often uses multibyte data.

Understanding multibyte data is essential for working with low-level operations, such as binary file handling, network protocols, and memory management.
