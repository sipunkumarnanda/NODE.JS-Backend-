### Base-64 Encoding

**Definition**:  
- Base-64 encoding is a character encoding scheme that converts binary data into a textual string format. It encodes the data in such a way that each group of 3 bytes (24 bits) is represented as 4 printable ASCII characters. This ensures the data can be safely transmitted over text-based protocols like HTTP or email.

- Base-64 encoding is a method of encoding binary data into a textual representation that consists of 64 printable ASCII characters. This is primarily used for encoding data to be safely transmitted over text-based protocols such as email (MIME) or stored in systems that can only handle text.

#### **How Base-64 Encoding Works**
1. **Binary Data Conversion**:
   - The input data (binary or string) is first converted to a stream of binary bits. If the input is a string, it is encoded to binary using UTF-8 or another character encoding format.
2. **Divide into 6-bit Groups**:
   - The binary stream is divided into chunks of 6 bits. Each 6-bit chunk can represent a value between `0` and `63`.
3. **Map to Base-64 Characters**:
   - Each 6-bit value is mapped to a corresponding Base-64 character from the Base-64 table.
4. **Padding**:
   - If the input data isn't a multiple of 3 bytes (24 bits), padding characters (`=`) are added to make the output length a multiple of 4.

- Padding (`=`) is used to fill in missing bits when the input is not a multiple of 3 bytes.

#### **Base-64: A Subset of ASCII**
- The Base-64 table contains 64 printable characters, all of which are part of the ASCII character set.
- ASCII includes 128 characters, including control characters and printable symbols.
- Base-64 uses only the printable subset of ASCII characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `+`, and `/`).

### **Why Use Base-64?**
1. **Safe for Text-based Systems**:
   - Many systems (like emails or URLs) can only handle text and not binary data.
   - Base-64 converts binary data into a textual format that these systems can handle.
   
2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Base-64 ensures that the data remains unchanged during transmission, even through systems that may misinterpret binary data.

3. **Common Use Cases**:
   - Encoding images, files, or binary content into JSON or HTML.
   - Safely transmitting data in URLs, HTTP headers, or emails.
