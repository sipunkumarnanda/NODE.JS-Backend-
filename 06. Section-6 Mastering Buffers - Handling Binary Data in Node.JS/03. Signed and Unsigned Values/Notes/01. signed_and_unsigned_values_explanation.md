### Signed and Unsigned Values: Detailed Notes from Scratch

In computing, **signed** and **unsigned** values refer to how numbers are represented in binary form, with **signed** values allowing for both positive and negative numbers, while **unsigned** values only represent non-negative numbers. Understanding the difference between these two is fundamental in programming and low-level data manipulation.

### 1. **Binary Representation Overview**

Computers represent numbers using **binary** (base-2), where each digit (bit) can be either `0` or `1`. For example:
- `0` is `00000000` in 8-bit binary.
- `1` is `00000001` in 8-bit binary.
- `255` is `11111111` in 8-bit binary (the highest value in 8 bits).

### 2. **Unsigned Values**

An **unsigned** value is a binary number that can only represent **non-negative numbers** (zero or positive). Since all bits are used to represent the magnitude, the range of unsigned values depends on the number of bits available.

For example:
- In an 8-bit system, an unsigned integer can represent values from `0` to `255`, inclusive.
  - `00000000` = 0 (decimal)
  - `11111111` = 255 (decimal)

The formula for the range of unsigned numbers is:
- **Minimum value**: `0`
- **Maximum value**: \(2^n - 1\), where `n` is the number of bits.
  
  So for 8 bits, the range is:
  \[
  \text{Minimum} = 0, \quad \text{Maximum} = 2^8 - 1 = 255
  \]

#### Key Characteristics of Unsigned Values:
- **Only positive values**: There are no negative numbers.
- **Bit representation**: All bits are used to store the number's magnitude.
- **Range**: The range is from 0 to \(2^n - 1\) (where `n` is the number of bits).

#### Example: 8-bit Unsigned Binary Values
- `00000000` = 0
- `00000001` = 1
- `01111111` = 127
- `11111111` = 255

### 3. **Signed Values**

A **signed** value represents both **positive** and **negative** numbers. In binary systems, one bit is used to represent the sign of the number, typically the **most significant bit** (MSB, the leftmost bit). This allows the remaining bits to store the magnitude of the number.

There are several ways to represent signed numbers in binary, but the two most common methods are:

- **Sign-and-magnitude representation**
- **Two's complement representation**

We will focus on **Two's complement**, which is the most widely used method in modern computing.

### 4. **Two's Complement Representation**

In **Two's complement**, the leftmost bit (MSB) indicates the sign:
- `0` means positive.
- `1` means negative.

The key advantage of Two's complement is that it simplifies arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. It also eliminates the problem of having two representations for zero (which happens in **1's complement**).

#### How to Represent Negative Numbers in Two's Complement:
1. **Find the binary representation** of the positive number.
2. **Invert all the bits** (flip 0s to 1s, and 1s to 0s).
3. **Add 1** to the result.

This process allows you to represent negative numbers in a way that is consistent with binary arithmetic.

#### Example: Representing -5 in Two's Complement (8-bit)
1. The binary of +5 is: `00000101`
2. Invert the bits: `11111010`
3. Add 1: `11111010 + 1 = 11111011`

Thus, `-5` in Two's complement (8-bit) is `11111011`.

#### Range of Signed Values (Two's Complement):
In an 8-bit Two's complement system:
- The **positive range** is from `0` to `127` (same as unsigned).
- The **negative range** is from `-128` to `-1`.

The formula for the range of signed numbers in Two's complement is:
- **Minimum value**: \( -2^{(n-1)} \)
- **Maximum value**: \( 2^{(n-1)} - 1 \)

For 8 bits, the range is:
- **Minimum**: \( -2^7 = -128 \)
- **Maximum**: \( 2^7 - 1 = 127 \)

#### Example: 8-bit Signed Binary Values (Two's complement)
- `00000000` = 0
- `00000001` = 1
- `01111111` = 127
- `10000000` = -128
- `11111111` = -1

### 5. **Sign-and-Magnitude Representation (Alternative to Two's Complement)**

In **sign-and-magnitude representation**, the leftmost bit (MSB) is used to represent the sign, while the remaining bits represent the magnitude (absolute value) of the number. This method is simpler but has the drawback of having two representations for zero: `+0` (all bits 0) and `-0` (MSB is 1, rest of the bits 0).

For example, in an 8-bit sign-and-magnitude system:
- `00000001` = +1
- `10000001` = -1 (with a leading 1 to indicate negative sign)
- `00000000` = +0
- `10000000` = -0

Sign-and-magnitude representation is rarely used in modern systems because **Two's complement** is more efficient and doesn't have the problem of two zeros.

### 6. **Summary of Signed vs Unsigned Values**

| **Aspect**                 | **Unsigned Values**                        | **Signed Values**                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Bit Usage**               | All bits represent the magnitude           | One bit (MSB) represents the sign       |
| **Range**                   | `0` to \(2^n - 1\)                        | \(-2^{(n-1)}\) to \(2^{(n-1)} - 1\)     |
| **Negative Numbers**        | Not represented                            | Can represent negative numbers (in Two's complement) |
| **Common Use**              | Representing quantities like size, count   | Representing values where both positive and negative are needed |
| **Examples (8-bit)**        | `00000000` = 0, `11111111` = 255           | `00000000` = 0, `11111111` = -1          |

### 7. **When to Use Signed vs Unsigned Values**
- **Use unsigned values** when:
  - You need to represent only **non-negative** values (e.g., counting items, memory sizes).
  - The range you need can be fully accommodated within the available bits.
  
- **Use signed values** when:
  - You need to represent **both positive and negative** values (e.g., temperatures, bank balances, etc.).
  - You are performing arithmetic operations where negative values are possible.

---

These notes cover the essential concepts behind **signed** and **unsigned** values, focusing on their binary representation and when to use each type. Let me know if you'd like more examples or further explanation!

---
---
---

To understand how negative numbers are represented in binary, let's break it down step by step, starting with some basics.

### 1. **Binary Numbers (Unsigned)**
In binary, numbers are represented using just 0s and 1s. An unsigned binary number can only represent positive values. For example, an 8-bit unsigned binary number can represent values from `0` to `255`:

- `00000000` (binary) = 0 (decimal)
- `00000001` (binary) = 1 (decimal)
- `11111111` (binary) = 255 (decimal)

### 2. **Signed Binary Numbers**
Now, when we need to represent **negative** numbers, we need a way to tell if a number is positive or negative. In computers, this is often done using a special technique, such as **Two's complement**.

### 3. **Signed Binary Representation (Two's Complement)**
In a signed binary number, one bit is reserved to indicate the sign (positive or negative). Usually, in 8-bit systems:
- The **leftmost bit** (also called the **most significant bit** or **MSB**) is used for the sign:
  - `0` = positive
  - `1` = negative

This means that with 8 bits, we can represent numbers from `-128` to `+127` in decimal.

#### 3.1 **Positive Numbers in Two's Complement**
For positive numbers, the representation is the same as unsigned binary numbers. For example:
- `00000001` (binary) = 1 (decimal)
- `01101001` (binary) = 105 (decimal)

#### 3.2 **Negative Numbers in Two's Complement**
To represent negative numbers, you use **Two's complement**. The process to find the Two's complement of a number is as follows:
1. **Write the binary representation of the absolute value of the number.**
2. **Invert all bits** (flip 0s to 1s, and 1s to 0s).
3. **Add 1** to the inverted binary number.

Let's see an example to understand this.

### 4. **Example: Representing -5 in Binary (8-bit)**
To represent `-5` in binary:
1. Write the binary of 5: `00000101`
2. Invert the bits: `11111010`
3. Add 1: `11111010 + 1 = 11111011`

So, the binary representation of `-5` is `11111011` (in 8-bit Two's complement).

### 5. **Why Two's Complement?**
- It makes **addition** and **subtraction** easier because adding two numbers in Two's complement automatically handles the sign.
- It ensures there is exactly one representation for zero (`00000000` in both unsigned and signed representation).

### 6. **Summary**
- **Unsigned binary**: Represents only positive numbers (e.g., `0` to `255` in 8 bits).
- **Signed binary (Two's complement)**: Represents both positive and negative numbers (e.g., `-128` to `+127` in 8 bits).

The choice between using **1's complement** and **2's complement** for representing negative numbers primarily depends on the system or context you're working in. Let me explain both techniques so you can understand when and why one might be used over the other.

### 1. **1's Complement**
In **1's complement** representation, negative numbers are represented by **inverting all the bits** of the positive number. Here's how it works:

#### Steps to Represent a Negative Number in 1's Complement:
1. Start with the **binary representation of the positive number**.
2. **Invert all the bits** (flip 0s to 1s, and 1s to 0s).

For example, to represent `-5` in 8-bit 1's complement:
- Start with the binary representation of `5`: `00000101`
- Invert all the bits: `11111010`

Thus, `-5` in 1's complement would be `11111010`.

#### Issues with 1's Complement:
- **Two representations for zero**: You can have both `00000000` (positive zero) and `11111111` (negative zero), which can create ambiguity and complications in arithmetic operations.
- **Addition/subtraction**: 1's complement requires special handling for carries when adding negative and positive numbers.

Despite these issues, **1's complement** was used in early computer systems. However, it has largely been replaced by **2's complement** because 2's complement is simpler and avoids the "negative zero" problem.

### 2. **2's Complement**
In **2's complement**, negative numbers are represented by **inverting all the bits** of the positive number and then **adding 1** to the result. This method avoids the ambiguity of "negative zero" and simplifies arithmetic operations.

#### Steps to Represent a Negative Number in 2's Complement:
1. Start with the **binary representation of the positive number**.
2. **Invert all the bits** (flip 0s to 1s, and 1s to 0s).
3. **Add 1** to the inverted binary number.

For example, to represent `-5` in 8-bit 2's complement:
- Start with the binary representation of `5`: `00000101`
- Invert the bits: `11111010`
- Add 1: `11111010 + 1 = 11111011`

Thus, `-5` in 2's complement would be `11111011`.

#### Why 2's Complement is Preferred:
- **Only one representation for zero**: `00000000` is zero, avoiding the confusion of "negative zero."
- **Simpler arithmetic**: 2's complement makes it easier to perform binary addition and subtraction because you don't need to handle carries separately when adding positive and negative numbers.
- **Widely used**: Most modern computer systems use **2's complement** for signed integer representation due to these advantages.

### **When to Use 1's Complement vs 2's Complement:**
- **1's Complement**: You might encounter this in historical computing systems, but it is not widely used today due to its limitations (e.g., two zeros).
- **2's Complement**: This is the most commonly used system in modern computing, including in programming languages, processors, and hardware, because it handles negative numbers more efficiently and avoids the problems of 1's complement.

### Conclusion:
In almost all modern systems and programming languages (including JavaScript), **2's complement** is the standard for representing signed integers. **1's complement** is typically encountered in older systems and is now less common.

The limitation to representing only values from `-128` to `127` in **8-bit signed binary numbers** comes from how the **Two's complement** system works and the way binary numbers are represented.

Let’s break it down:

### **8-bit Two's Complement Representation**

In an **8-bit system**, there are 8 binary digits (bits) to represent a number. The first bit (the **most significant bit**, MSB) is used to determine the **sign** of the number. Here's how the bit allocation works:

- **1 bit for the sign**: If the MSB is `0`, the number is positive. If the MSB is `1`, the number is negative.
- **7 bits for the magnitude**: The remaining 7 bits represent the **magnitude** of the number, whether positive or negative.

### **Maximum Positive Value (127)**
- When the MSB is `0`, we are dealing with a **positive number**.
- The maximum positive value occurs when all the other 7 bits are `1`, which gives us `01111111` in binary.
- This is the number `127` in decimal because:
  - `01111111` = \( 1 \times 2^6 + 1 \times 2^5 + 1 \times 2^4 + 1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 \)
  - Which equals `127`.

So, the **maximum positive value** that can be represented in 8 bits is **127**.

### **Maximum Negative Value (-128)**
- When the MSB is `1`, we are dealing with a **negative number**.
- The most negative number occurs when all the other bits are `0`, which gives us `10000000` in binary.
- This is the number `-128` in decimal because:
  - In Two's complement, `10000000` represents the **smallest (most negative) number**, which is **-128**.
  - The conversion process for Two's complement negative numbers involves flipping the bits of the positive number and adding 1. This creates a number that, when interpreted in Two's complement, results in `-128` rather than a positive value.

Thus, the **minimum negative value** that can be represented in 8 bits is **-128**.

### **Why -128 and not -127?**
- **Two's complement representation** does not allow `-127` because it needs to represent **exactly** zero as `00000000` (in both positive and negative representation). This means the negative range starts at `-128` and the positive range ends at `127`.
- The number of available values for negative numbers in Two's complement is **one greater** than for positive numbers, because we reserve a binary representation (`10000000`) for `-128`, and we can't represent `-127` separately from `127` in an 8-bit system.

### **Summary**
- The **range** of signed values in 8-bit Two's complement is from **-128 to 127**.
- **-128** is the most negative number because it uses the MSB to indicate negative, and the remaining bits represent the magnitude (which is \( 2^7 = 128 \)).
- **127** is the maximum positive value because the MSB is `0` and all other bits are `1` for the highest possible positive number.
  
This is a direct result of how **Two's complement** works to represent negative numbers and how it balances the representation of positive and negative values.

---
---
---

To convert a **negative number** to its **positive equivalent** in **Two's complement**, you essentially reverse the process used to create the negative number. This means you:

1. **Start with the binary representation of the negative number.**
2. **Invert all the bits** (flip 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s).
3. **Add 1** to the result.

Let's see this step-by-step:

---

### Example: Convert -5 to +5 in Two's Complement (8-bit)

1. **Start with the binary representation of -5 (in Two's complement):**
   - For -5, the binary representation in 8 bits is: `11111011`.

2. **Invert all the bits:**
   - Flip every bit (1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1):  
     `11111011` → `00000100`.

3. **Add 1 to the result:**
   - Add `1` to `00000100`:  
     `00000100 + 1 = 00000101`.

4. **Result:**
   - `00000101` is the binary representation of `+5` in 8-bit.

---

### Verification: Check if the Conversion is Correct
To verify, we can reverse the process and confirm that converting `+5` back to Two's complement gives `-5`.

1. Binary for `+5` is `00000101`.
2. Invert all the bits: `00000101 → 11111010`.
3. Add 1: `11111010 + 1 = 11111011`.
4. `11111011` is the Two's complement representation of `-5`.

---

### Important Notes:
- **Positive to Negative:** The process is the same: invert the bits and add 1.
- **Special Case (Most Negative Number):** The most negative number in Two's complement (e.g., `-128` in 8 bits: `10000000`) cannot be converted to a positive number because its magnitude is beyond the range of positive values that can be represented.

---
---
---

In **Two's complement**, the most negative number (e.g., `-128` in an 8-bit system) **cannot be converted** to a positive number because its magnitude exceeds the range of positive numbers that can be represented in the same bit width. Here's why:

---

### **Why -128 Can't Be Converted to Positive in 8-bit Two's Complement**

#### 1. **Range of 8-bit Signed Values**
- In an 8-bit Two's complement system:
  - **Positive range:** \( 0 \) to \( +127 \) (\( 01111111 \)).
  - **Negative range:** \( -1 \) to \( -128 \) (\( 10000000 \)).

There is no binary representation for \( +128 \) in an 8-bit signed system because \( +128 \) falls outside the range of representable values. The maximum positive value is \( +127 \).

---

### **What Happens When You Try?**

Let’s attempt to "convert" `-128` to positive by following the usual Two's complement process:

1. **Binary representation of -128:**
   - In 8-bit Two's complement, `-128` is: `10000000`.

2. **Invert the bits:**
   - Invert all bits of `10000000`:  
     `10000000 → 01111111`.

3. **Add 1:**
   - Add `1` to `01111111`:  
     `01111111 + 1 = 10000000`.

4. **Result:**
   - The result is `10000000`, which is **still -128** in Two's complement.

---

### **Conclusion**

- The process results in the same value, `10000000`. This is because the magnitude of `-128` cannot fit into the positive range of an 8-bit signed system.
- **Key takeaway:** The most negative value in Two's complement is a unique case and cannot be converted to a positive equivalent within the same bit width.

---
---
---

The reason we **can't convert -128 to +128** in an **8-bit Two's complement system** lies in the **bit-width limitations** and the way Two's complement is designed. Let’s explore why this happens in detail.

---

### 1. **The Range of Values in 8-bit Two's Complement**
In an 8-bit system, the range of numbers is:
- **Negative range:** \(-2^{n-1} = -2^7 = -128\)
- **Positive range:** \(2^{n-1} - 1 = 2^7 - 1 = 127\)

This range is **asymmetric**:
- There is **one extra value on the negative side** because zero takes one of the available numbers in the positive range.

The extra negative number arises because the bit pattern for \( -128 \) (`10000000`) does not have a corresponding positive counterpart. Simply put, \( +128 \) cannot exist in an 8-bit system because we don’t have enough bit patterns to represent it.

---

### 2. **Why Two's Complement is Asymmetric**
Two's complement uses one bit (the **most significant bit**, MSB) to indicate the sign:
- \( 0 \): Positive
- \( 1 \): Negative

For \( n \) bits:
- \( 2^{n-1} \) numbers are reserved for positive values and zero (\( 0 \) to \( 2^{n-1} - 1 \)).
- \( 2^{n-1} \) numbers are reserved for negative values (\( -1 \) to \( -2^{n-1} \)).

Since there are an **even number of binary combinations**, one more value naturally ends up on the negative side. This makes the system efficient for arithmetic operations but results in this asymmetry.

---

### 3. **What Happens When You Try to Convert -128 to Positive**
When you invert the bits and add 1 to convert `-128` (`10000000`) to positive:
1. **Step 1: Invert all bits**:  
   `10000000 → 01111111`
2. **Step 2: Add 1**:  
   `01111111 + 1 = 10000000`

The result is **`10000000`**, which is still `-128`. This is because \( -128 \) is at the very edge of the range, and the Two's complement operation effectively wraps around to itself.

---

### 4. **Why This Design is Beneficial**
The asymmetry and inability to convert \( -128 \) to \( +128 \) in an 8-bit system isn’t a flaw; it’s a trade-off that makes Two's complement arithmetic efficient:
- **Single representation for zero:** Two's complement avoids the problem of having both `+0` and `-0`.
- **Efficient arithmetic operations:** Addition, subtraction, and multiplication can be performed without extra handling for signs or special cases.
- **Fixed-width simplicity:** The same bit patterns can represent both positive and negative numbers without additional overhead.

---

### 5. **How to Handle This Issue**
If you need to represent \( +128 \), you must **increase the bit width**. For example:
- In a **16-bit Two's complement system**, the range of values is:
  - Negative: \( -32,768 \)
  - Positive: \( +32,767 \)
- This allows plenty of room for \( +128 \) and any other larger values.

---

### **Summary**
- **Why you can't convert -128 to +128 in 8-bit Two's complement:** The system's design limits the positive range to \( +127 \) because it allocates half of the bit patterns for negative numbers and zero.
- **Solution:** Use a larger bit width (e.g., 16 bits) if you need to represent larger positive numbers.
