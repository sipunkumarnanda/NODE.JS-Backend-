In Git, file permissions are important because they determine how a file can be accessed or executed. When you run commands like `git ls-files --stage` or view a Git tree, you'll often see file permissions in a numeric format like `100644`, `100755`, `120000`, and `040000`. These are **file mode bits** that Git uses to track file types and permissions.

Here’s a detailed explanation of these Git file permission modes:

---

### **Git File Permission Modes**

Git uses four primary permission modes to represent files and directories:

1. **`100644` (Regular File - Read/Write)**
2. **`100755` (Executable File - Read/Write/Execute)**
3. **`120000` (Symbolic Link)**
4. **`040000` (Directory)**

#### 1. **`100644` (Regular File - Read/Write)**

- **Description**: This mode represents a regular file that is readable and writable, but **not executable**.
- **Breakdown**:
  - `100`: This part specifies that it is a regular file.
  - `644`: This is the **Unix-style permission** in octal format:
    - `6` for the **owner**: Read (`4`) + Write (`2`) = **6** (Read and Write).
    - `4` for the **group**: Read-only (`4`).
    - `4` for **others**: Read-only (`4`).
- **Usage**: This is the default mode for most files in Git. When a file is added to the repository without the executable bit set, Git assigns it the `100644` permission.

#### Example:
```bash
$ git ls-files --stage
100644 blob 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678    file.txt
```
In this example, `file.txt` is a regular file with read/write permissions for the owner and read-only for the group and others.

#### 2. **`100755` (Executable File - Read/Write/Execute)**

- **Description**: This mode is for files that are **executable**, in addition to being readable and writable.
- **Breakdown**:
  - `100`: Indicates that it's a regular file.
  - `755`: Represents Unix-style permissions:
    - `7` for the **owner**: Read (`4`) + Write (`2`) + Execute (`1`) = **7** (Read, Write, and Execute).
    - `5` for the **group**: Read (`4`) + Execute (`1`) = **5** (Read and Execute).
    - `5` for **others**: Read (`4`) + Execute (`1`) = **5** (Read and Execute).
- **Usage**: Files with this permission are generally scripts (like `.sh` files) or executables that need to be run directly from the shell.

#### Example:
```bash
$ git ls-files --stage
100755 blob 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678    script.sh
```
In this example, `script.sh` is executable, and Git sets its mode to `100755`.

#### 3. **`120000` (Symbolic Link)**

- **Description**: This mode represents a **symbolic link** (symlink). A symlink is a file that points to another file or directory.
- **Breakdown**:
  - `120`: Indicates that the file is a symbolic link.
  - `000`: Symlinks don’t have traditional file permissions because they just point to another file or directory.
- **Usage**: This is used when you add a symbolic link to the Git repository.

#### Example:
```bash
$ git ls-files --stage
120000 blob 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678    link-to-file
```
In this case, `link-to-file` is a symbolic link, and Git sets its mode to `120000`.

---

#### 4. **`040000` (Directory)**

- **Description**: This mode represents a **directory** in the Git tree.
- **Breakdown**:
  - `040`: Indicates that it’s a directory.
  - `000`: Directories don’t need traditional file permissions in Git since the permissions on directories are handled by the operating system, not by Git directly.
- **Usage**: Git assigns this mode to directories in the repository to differentiate them from regular files or symlinks.

#### Example:
```bash
$ git ls-files --stage
040000 tree 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678    directory/
```
Here, `directory/` is a directory, and Git represents it with `040000` in its tree.

### **Understanding the Breakdown of the File Mode**:

In Git, the file mode is represented by a 6-digit octal number, broken down as follows:

- **The First 3 Digits**: These represent the type of the file.
  - `100` for a regular file.
  - `120` for a symbolic link.
  - `040` for a directory.

- **The Last 3 Digits**: These represent the **file permissions** in the Unix permission format.
  - `644` means the file is read/write for the owner and read-only for the group and others.
  - `755` means the file is executable for the owner and readable/executable for the group and others.

### **Summary of Git File Modes**:

| Mode    | Description                        | Type           | Permissions        |
|---------|------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| `100644`| Regular file, read/write           | Regular File   | `rw-r--r--` (644)  |
| `100755`| Regular file, executable           | Executable File| `rwxr-xr-x` (755)  |
| `120000`| Symbolic link                      | Symlink        | -                  |
| `040000`| Directory                          | Directory      | -                  |

### **How to View Git File Permissions**:
You can use the following Git command to see the file permissions and other details:
```bash
git ls-files --stage
```
This will list all the tracked files along with their permission modes and hash identifiers.

### **Modifying Permissions in Git**:
Git doesn’t track every kind of file permission (such as changing only the write permission for a group). It only tracks whether a file is executable or not. Therefore:
- To change a file from non-executable to executable (or vice versa), you can use the following commands:
  
  **Make a file executable:**
  ```bash
  chmod +x filename
  ```

  **Make a file non-executable:**
  ```bash
  chmod -x filename
  ```

After changing permissions, make sure to add and commit the file for the permission change to be tracked in Git.

### **Conclusion**:
- Git uses specific file modes to represent file types and permissions (`100644`, `100755`, `120000`, `040000`).
- The first three digits of the file mode indicate the file type, and the last three digits are the Unix-style permission bits (read, write, execute).
- Git primarily tracks whether files are executable or not and does not track more fine-grained permissions beyond that.
  
By understanding these file modes, you can better manage file permissions and types in your Git repositories.
