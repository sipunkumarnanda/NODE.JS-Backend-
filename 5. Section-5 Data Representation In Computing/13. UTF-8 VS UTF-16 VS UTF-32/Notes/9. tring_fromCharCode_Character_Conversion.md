### **`String.fromCharCode()` in JavaScript**

The method **`String.fromCharCode()`** in JavaScript is used to **create a string** from one or more Unicode code points. It takes one or more **numeric arguments** (code points) and returns a string corresponding to those code points. 

### **Basic Usage of `String.fromCharCode()`**

- **Syntax:**  
  ```javascript
  String.fromCharCode(num1, num2, ..., numN)
  ```
  Where `num1, num2, ..., numN` are the **Unicode code points** (integer values).

#### **Example:**
```javascript
let char = String.fromCharCode(72, 101, 108, 108, 111); // Unicode code points for "Hello"
console.log(char); // Output: "Hello"
```

In the above example:
- `72` represents `'H'`, `101` represents `'e'`, `108` represents `'l'`, and `111` represents `'o'`.
- The `String.fromCharCode()` method takes those code points and converts them into their respective characters to form the string `"Hello"`.

### **What Does `String.fromCharCode()` Do?**

- **Converts Unicode code points (decimal values) to characters.**
- Each argument you pass corresponds to the **Unicode code unit** (a decimal number) of a character.
- It can handle a range of characters represented by **code points** from `0` to `65535` (i.e., the **Basic Multilingual Plane**, BMP), which covers many of the characters used in everyday text (Latin, Arabic, Chinese, etc.).

### **Why Does `String.fromCharCode()` Only Take Decimal or Hexadecimal?**

#### 1. **Decimal Code Points:**
The method **`String.fromCharCode()`** is designed to take **decimal values** as input, representing Unicode code points. These values directly map to the internal encoding of characters (UTF-16 code units), which is why **decimal values** are commonly used.

- **Unicode Representation:** Unicode code points are stored as numbers in most programming languages, including JavaScript. They are typically represented in **decimal** or **hexadecimal** form. The decimal value corresponds directly to the character encoding.
  
#### 2. **Hexadecimal Representation:**
Hexadecimal (base 16) is often used as a **more compact representation** of **decimal values** because it's easier to work with in **memory** and **computing contexts**. Each hexadecimal digit represents exactly 4 bits, which aligns well with 16-bit Unicode code units in UTF-16.

When we write a hexadecimal value (e.g., `0x0041`), it’s simply another form of representing the decimal code point (`65`), where:
- `0x0041` (hexadecimal) → `65` (decimal) → `'A'` in Unicode.

For example:
```javascript
let hexChar = String.fromCharCode(0x0041); // Converts hex 0x0041 (A) to character
console.log(hexChar); // Output: "A"
```

This works because `String.fromCharCode()` takes **integer values**. You can use a **hexadecimal value** by passing it as a regular JavaScript **number** (since JavaScript treats numbers as either decimal or hexadecimal depending on the format).

#### **Why Can't `String.fromCharCode()` Directly Handle Binary?**

1. **Binary Input Not Supported by `fromCharCode()`**:
   - **`String.fromCharCode()`** is designed to work with **decimal numbers** (code points). While **binary** is a valid way of representing numbers, JavaScript expects a number in the **decimal format** (or hexadecimal) as input.
   - The method **does not** have built-in support for **binary** directly because binary is typically an intermediary format (like machine code or data representation). In JavaScript, binary values are often converted into decimal or hexadecimal when working with Unicode.

2. **Binary Can Be Converted**:
   - You can **convert binary** to **decimal** (or hexadecimal) before passing it into `String.fromCharCode()`:
   ```javascript
   let binaryValue = '1000001'; // Binary for 'A' (U+0041)
   let decimalValue = parseInt(binaryValue, 2); // Convert binary to decimal
   let character = String.fromCharCode(decimalValue); // Use decimal value in fromCharCode
   console.log(character); // Output: "A"
   ```

   In this example:
   - The binary value `1000001` represents the Unicode code point for `'A'`, which is `65` in decimal.
   - You can convert the binary string to decimal using `parseInt(binaryString, 2)` and then pass that decimal value into `String.fromCharCode()`.

### **Summary:**

- **`String.fromCharCode()`** converts **decimal code points** into characters, where each argument represents a **Unicode code point**.
- **Hexadecimal** values can be passed directly because they are just a shorthand for **decimal numbers**.
- **Binary** numbers need to be converted to decimal before being passed to `String.fromCharCode()`, as the method expects **integer values** and does not accept binary directly.
- The **decimal** and **hexadecimal** formats are used because they are standard representations of Unicode code points in **JavaScript** and most **character encoding systems**.
