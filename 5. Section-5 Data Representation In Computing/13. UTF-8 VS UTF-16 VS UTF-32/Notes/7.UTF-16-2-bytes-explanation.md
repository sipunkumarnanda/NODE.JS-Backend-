### **Why UTF-8 Uses 1 Byte and UTF-16 Uses 2 Bytes to Store a Character**

#### **1. UTF-8 (1 Byte for ASCII Characters)**

- **Character Representation**: UTF-8 is a **variable-length encoding**, meaning it can use anywhere from **1 to 4 bytes** to represent a single character depending on the characterâ€™s Unicode code point.
  
- **ASCII Compatibility**: UTF-8 was designed to be backward-compatible with **ASCII**. ASCII uses 1 byte (8 bits) to represent each character, and this range is from `U+0000` to `U+007F` (a total of 128 characters). UTF-8 keeps the exact same representation for these characters, meaning it uses **1 byte** for characters in the ASCII range.
  
- **How 1 Byte Works in UTF-8**:  
  For example:
  - **Character `A`**: Unicode code point `U+0041`.  
  - In binary, `A` becomes `01000001`, which is 1 byte (8 bits).  
  - This is exactly the same as its ASCII representation, so it uses **1 byte**.

#### **Example: UTF-8 with 1 Byte**
- **Character `A`** (`U+0041`):
  - **Unicode**: `U+0041`
  - **UTF-8**: `01000001` (1 byte)

#### **2. UTF-16 (2 Bytes for Most Characters)**

- **Character Representation**: UTF-16 is a **variable-length encoding** as well, but most characters use **2 bytes** (16 bits). However, it can extend to **4 bytes** for supplementary characters (those outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, or BMP).
  
- **Why 2 Bytes**: UTF-16 uses **16 bits (2 bytes)** to represent characters in the **BMP** (Unicode range `U+0000` to `U+FFFF`). The BMP includes most common characters, such as those used in modern languages (e.g., Latin, Greek, Arabic). The idea behind this is that 2 bytes can comfortably represent a wide range of characters.

- **How 2 Bytes Work in UTF-16**:  
  For example:
  - **Character `A`**: Unicode code point `U+0041`.  
  - In binary, `A` becomes `00000000 01000001` (2 bytes or 16 bits).
  
- **Additional Characters**: Characters outside the BMP, like emojis or certain rare languages, use 4 bytes (2 16-bit units called **surrogate pairs**).

#### **Example: UTF-16 with 2 Bytes**
- **Character `A`** (`U+0041`):
  - **Unicode**: `U+0041`
  - **UTF-16**: `00000000 01000001` (2 bytes)

### **Key Differences and Summary**

| **Encoding**   | **Bytes per Character**                  | **Characters Represented**                | **Example**            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **UTF-8**      | 1 byte for ASCII characters (U+0000â€“U+007F), up to 4 bytes for others | 1 byte for basic English letters, 2-4 bytes for other scripts (e.g., emojis) | `A` (U+0041) â†’ `01000001` (1 byte) |
| **UTF-16**     | 2 bytes for characters in the BMP (U+0000â€“U+FFFF), 4 bytes for others | Common characters use 2 bytes, less common or supplementary characters use 4 bytes | `A` (U+0041) â†’ `00000000 01000001` (2 bytes) |

#### **Why Different Byte Sizes?**
- **UTF-8** is optimized for **space efficiency**, particularly for text that consists mainly of ASCII characters (1 byte).
- **UTF-16** is designed to be more **efficient for scripts** that have a large number of characters in the BMP, such as Asian languages, which fit easily within 2 bytes.

This is why **UTF-8** uses **1 byte** for basic characters like English letters, and **UTF-16** uses **2 bytes** for characters in the BMP, thus providing different space trade-offs for encoding text.

### **Why UTF-16 Uses 2 Bytes for 1 Character**

#### **1. Character Representation in UTF-16**

UTF-16 is a **variable-length encoding** that typically uses **2 bytes (16 bits)** to represent a single character. This is the default behavior for characters in the **Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)**, which includes the majority of commonly used characters in most modern languages.

#### **2. The 16-Bit (2 Byte) Standard**

The **Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)** of Unicode consists of code points from `U+0000` to `U+FFFF`. This means that there are **65,536** possible characters in this range. Since **16 bits** (2 bytes) can represent 65,536 distinct values (`2^16 = 65536`), it is enough to encode all the characters in the BMP using **2 bytes per character**.

#### **Why 2 Bytes (16 Bits)?**
- **Efficiency**: A 16-bit number can represent all the characters in the **BMP**, which covers a large portion of the world's most commonly used scripts (e.g., Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, Korean).
- **Design Decision**: UTF-16 was designed to accommodate a wide range of characters efficiently. **16 bits** were chosen because it was enough to cover a large majority of modern languages while still being compact.
- **Simplicity**: 2-byte encoding simplifies processing by allowing for more compact storage of characters compared to fixed-width 4-byte encodings like UTF-32, while still providing sufficient space for most languages.

#### **Example of UTF-16 with 2 Bytes**

- For characters in the BMP, like `A` (Unicode `U+0041`), UTF-16 stores the character using **2 bytes**:
  
  - **Character `A`** (`U+0041`):
    - Unicode Code Point: `U+0041`
    - UTF-16 Binary: `00000000 01000001` (2 bytes or 16 bits)

  This shows that a **16-bit** value is used to represent this character in UTF-16, allowing it to efficiently represent many common characters.

#### **3. Characters Outside the BMP (Supplementary Characters)**

For characters **outside the BMP** (Unicode code points from `U+10000` to `U+10FFFF`), UTF-16 uses a **surrogate pair** approach, where the character is encoded in **2 sets of 2 bytes**, totaling **4 bytes** for those supplementary characters. This allows UTF-16 to represent over 1 million characters.

- Example: For characters like emojis (e.g., ðŸ˜Š `U+1F60A`), which are outside the BMP, UTF-16 uses a pair of 2-byte units (surrogate pairs) to represent them.

---

### **Summary**

- **UTF-16 uses 2 bytes for characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)** because 16 bits (2 bytes) are enough to cover the range of `U+0000` to `U+FFFF`, which includes most commonly used characters across the world's languages.
- **16 bits** (2 bytes) allow efficient encoding of characters without wasting memory, while still providing ample space for a wide variety of scripts and symbols.
