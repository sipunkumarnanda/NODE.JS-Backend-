### **Why Does a Newly Created File Have 0 KB Size?**

When you create a file, such as `text.txt`, and check its size, it might show **0 KB** even though it appears to be there. This happens for a few reasons:

#### **1. Empty Files Have No Data**
- A **file size** refers to the amount of **data** (information) it contains. If the file has been created but **no data** has been added to it yet, it will have **0 KB**.
- In other words, the file exists as a **container** for data, but because there is no content inside, it does not occupy any measurable space on disk.
- For example, if you just create an empty text file (with no content written inside), the file system doesn't need to allocate space for it, so its size is **0 KB**.

#### **2. File System Metadata vs File Content**
- Even though a file exists in the file system, the operating system stores information about the file (like name, location, date created) in its **metadata**. This metadata doesn't count towards the **actual file size**.
- For example, when you create a new file, the system assigns it a **name** and **location** but doesn't allocate storage until content is added to the file.

#### **3. How File Systems Handle Empty Files**
- File systems like **NTFS**, **FAT32**, and **ext4** allocate space for file metadata. In the case of an **empty file**, that metadata is very small (usually a few bytes), but since there is no data, the file shows as 0 KB.

#### **4. Writing Data to the File**
- As soon as you add text, data, or any content inside the file, the file size will change to reflect how much space the content takes up. For example, if you add 100 bytes of text to `text.txt`, the file size will show as **100 bytes**.

#### **Summary**
A **0 KB file** simply means the file has been created, but it contains **no data** yet. Once you start adding content, the file will take up space on the disk and the size will increase accordingly. This is a normal behavior of file systems where **empty files** don't consume significant disk space.
