### **Why an Empty File Shows 2 Bytes in UTF-16 LE and BE Encoding**

When you create an empty file and check its size using UTF-16 LE (Little Endian) or UTF-16 BE (Big Endian), it may show as 2 bytes (or even more, depending on the environment). Here's why this happens:

### **Understanding UTF-16 Encoding**

**UTF-16** is a **variable-length encoding** that represents characters using **2 bytes** (16 bits) for most characters, but it also includes a feature called **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** to specify the endianness (byte order). UTF-16 can store characters using 2 or 4 bytes per character, depending on the character's Unicode code point.

### **Byte Order Mark (BOM)**

When you save a file in UTF-16 encoding (either Little Endian or Big Endian), **UTF-16 encoding automatically adds a BOM** to the beginning of the file. The BOM indicates the byte order (which byte comes first) to interpret the text correctly, especially when handling multi-byte characters.

- **UTF-16 LE (Little Endian)**: The BOM is `0xFF 0xFE`.
- **UTF-16 BE (Big Endian)**: The BOM is `0xFE 0xFF`.

### **Why Does an Empty File Have 2 Bytes?**

Even if the file has no text content, the BOM is added as metadata to indicate the encoding format used. This means:

1. **File with no content**: The file itself might be empty in terms of visible characters, but it still contains the BOM (which is 2 bytes long).
2. **Empty file in UTF-16 encoding**: The BOM (`0xFF 0xFE` or `0xFE 0xFF`) occupies 2 bytes and is considered part of the file even if there's no actual character data.

### **In Summary**
- An **empty file in UTF-16 encoding** will show 2 bytes because it includes the BOM.
- The BOM acts as a marker to specify the byte order and encoding format.
- The BOM is necessary for proper decoding and processing of UTF-16 encoded files.
