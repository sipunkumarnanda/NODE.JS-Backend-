# **Binary Number System**

## **Introduction to Number Systems**
A number system defines how we represent numbers in a structured way using symbols or digits. Common number systems include:

- **Decimal** (Base 10): Uses digits `{0 to 9}`.
- **Binary** (Base 2): Uses digits `{0, 1}`.
- **Octal** (Base 8): Uses digits `{0 to 7}`.
- **Hexadecimal** (Base 16): Uses digits `{0 to 9}` and `{A, B, C, D, E, F}`.

## **What is the Binary Number System?**
The **binary number system** is a base-2 system that uses only two digits: `0` and `1`. It is the foundation of digital electronics and computer systems because computers operate using binary data.

### Key Features:
1. Base: 2
2. Digits: `0`, `1`
3. Place Values: Powers of `2` (e.g., \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \dots\)).

## **Binary to Decimal Conversion**
To convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent:
1. Multiply each binary digit by \(2^n\), where \(n\) is its positional index (starting from 0 for the rightmost digit).
2. Add all the results together.

### Example 1: Convert Binary `1011` to Decimal
```
Binary: 1011
Step 1: Break into powers of 2:
1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 1
= 11 (Decimal)
```

## **Decimal to Binary Conversion**
To convert a decimal number to binary:
1. Divide the decimal number by `2`.
2. Record the remainder (0 or 1).
3. Repeat with the quotient until it becomes `0`.
4. Write the remainders in reverse order.

### Example 2: Convert Decimal `18` to Binary
```
18 ÷ 2 = 9, Remainder = 0
9 ÷ 2 = 4, Remainder = 1
4 ÷ 2 = 2, Remainder = 0
2 ÷ 2 = 1, Remainder = 0
1 ÷ 2 = 0, Remainder = 1
Binary: 10010
```

## **Binary Arithmetic**
Binary arithmetic is performed similarly to decimal arithmetic but follows base-2 rules.

### Rules for Binary Addition:
- `0 + 0 = 0`
- `0 + 1 = 1`
- `1 + 0 = 1`
- `1 + 1 = 10` (carry 1)

### Example 3: Add Binary Numbers `101` and `110`
```
   101
+  110
------
  1011
```

## **Practical Applications of Binary**
1. **Computers**: Data is stored, processed, and transmitted in binary.
2. **Logic Circuits**: Binary is used in digital electronics and logic gates.
3. **Networking**: IP addresses and subnet masks are often represented in binary.
4. **File Encoding**: Images, audio, and video files use binary encoding.

## **Binary in JavaScript**
### Converting Binary to Decimal in JavaScript
You can use the `parseInt` function:
```javascript
const binary = "1011";
const decimal = parseInt(binary, 2);
console.log(decimal); // Output: 11
```

### Converting Decimal to Binary in JavaScript
You can use the `toString` method:
```javascript
const decimal = 11;
const binary = decimal.toString(2);
console.log(binary); // Output: 1011
```

---

## **Advanced Example**
### Convert Binary `1001000000010001001101010101100010` to Decimal
**Steps:**
1. Break the binary into positional powers of 2.
2. Multiply each bit by \(2^n\), where \(n\) is its position from the right (starting at 0).

### Using JavaScript:
```javascript
const binary = "1001000000010001001101010101100010";
const decimal = parseInt(binary, 2);
console.log(decimal); // Output: 9668187490
```

**Decimal Equivalent:** `9668187490`

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Binary is a base-2 system using only `0` and `1`.
2. Conversions between binary and decimal involve powers of 2.
3. Binary arithmetic follows simple rules but underpins all modern computing.
4. Tools like `parseInt` and `toString` in JavaScript simplify binary and decimal conversions.
