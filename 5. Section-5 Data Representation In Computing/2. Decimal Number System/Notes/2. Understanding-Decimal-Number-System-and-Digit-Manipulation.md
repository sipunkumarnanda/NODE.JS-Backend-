### **Understanding the Decimal Number System Through a Step-by-Step Example**

---

#### **Problem Statement**

A two-digit number has digits \(x\) and \(y\) such that their sum is \(10\). When the original number is reversed and subtracted from the original, the result is a specific value. 

For example:
1. **When \(x = 6\) and \(y = 4\)**:
   - The original number is \(64\).
   - The reversed number is \(46\).
   - Subtraction: \(64 - 46 = 18\).

2. **For another case,** the subtraction result is \(36\). Find \(x\) and \(y\), and verify the solution.

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

#### **1. Represent the Numbers Mathematically**

- **Original Number**: \(10x + y\)  
  (\(x\): tens place, \(y\): ones place)

- **Reversed Number**: \(10y + x\)  

The difference between the original and reversed number:
\[
(10x + y) - (10y + x)
\]

Simplify:
\[
= 10x + y - 10y - x
\]
\[
= 9x - 9y
\]
\[
= 9(x - y)
\]

---

#### **2. Use the Given Conditions**

1. The subtraction result is \(36\):
   \[
   9(x - y) = 36
   \]

   Solve for \(x - y\):
   \[
   x - y = \frac{36}{9} = 4
   \]

2. The sum of the digits is \(10\):
   \[
   x + y = 10
   \]

---

#### **3. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\)**

Now we have two equations:
1. \(x - y = 4\)
2. \(x + y = 10\)

Add these equations:
\[
(x - y) + (x + y) = 4 + 10
\]
\[
2x = 14
\]
\[
x = 7
\]

Substitute \(x = 7\) into \(x + y = 10\):
\[
7 + y = 10
\]
\[
y = 3
\]

---

#### **4. Verify the Solution**

- **Original Number**:  
  \[
  10x + y = 10(7) + 3 = 73
  \]

- **Reversed Number**:  
  \[
  10y + x = 10(3) + 7 = 37
  \]

- **Subtraction**:  
  \[
  73 - 37 = 36
  \]

The solution satisfies the condition, so the digits are correct.

### **General Explanation Using the Example \(6 + 4 = 10\)**

#### **Case 1: \(x = 6, y = 4\)**

- **Original Number**: \(10(6) + 4 = 64\)  
- **Reversed Number**: \(10(4) + 6 = 46\)  
- **Subtraction**: \(64 - 46 = 18\)  

This matches the condition \(x + y = 10\), but here the subtraction result is \(18\).

---

#### **Case 2: \(x = 7, y = 3\)**

- **Original Number**: \(10(7) + 3 = 73\)  
- **Reversed Number**: \(10(3) + 7 = 37\)  
- **Subtraction**: \(73 - 37 = 36\)  

This satisfies both conditions:
1. \(x + y = 10\)
2. Subtraction result is \(36\).

---

### **Key Insights**

1. **Sum of Digits**: The sum of the digits remains constant (\(x + y = 10\)).  
2. **Place Value Importance**:  
   - \(10x\): Contribution of the tens place.  
   - \(y\): Contribution of the ones place.  
3. **Reversal Effect**: Reversing a number swaps the roles of \(x\) and \(y\) in the place value calculation.

4. **General Formula**:  
   - Subtraction result: \(9(x - y)\).

5. **Verification Process**: Always check results with the original and reversed numbers.
