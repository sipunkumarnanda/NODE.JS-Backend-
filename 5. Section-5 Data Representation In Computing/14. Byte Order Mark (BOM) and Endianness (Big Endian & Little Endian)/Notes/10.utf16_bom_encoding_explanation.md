# In **UTF-16**, the **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** behaves similarly to UTF-8 but with a different purpose and format. Here's how it works in **UTF-16 BE (Big Endian)** and **UTF-16 LE (Little Endian):**

---

### **Purpose of BOM in UTF-16**
1. **Endian Identification**:  
   Unlike UTF-8, where the BOM is optional and primarily used as an encoding identifier, the BOM in UTF-16 also indicates the **byte order** (Big Endian or Little Endian) of the file's content.
   - **Big Endian (BE)**: Most significant byte (MSB) comes first.
   - **Little Endian (LE)**: Least significant byte (LSB) comes first.
2. **Usage**:  
   - The BOM helps programs correctly interpret the byte sequence when reading UTF-16-encoded files.

---

### **BOM Representation in UTF-16**
- The BOM in UTF-16 is represented by the Unicode code point `U+FEFF` (Zero-Width No-Break Space).
- Its byte sequence differs based on the endian format:
  - **UTF-16 BE**: `FE FF`
  - **UTF-16 LE**: `FF FE`

---

### **Location of BOM**
- Like UTF-8, the BOM appears **only at the very beginning of the file** and does **not precede every character**.
- It acts as a file-level marker, not a character-level marker.

---

### **Example:**
Suppose the text in a file is `A` (Unicode `U+0041`):

1. **UTF-16 BE (Big Endian)**:  
   - BOM: `FE FF`
   - Character `A`: `00 41`
   - Byte sequence:  
     ```
     FE FF 00 41
     ```

2. **UTF-16 LE (Little Endian)**:  
   - BOM: `FF FE`
   - Character `A`: `41 00`
   - Byte sequence:  
     ```
     FF FE 41 00
     ```

---

### **Key Differences Between UTF-16 BE and LE**
- **Byte Order**:  
  - In BE, the most significant byte is stored first (`00 41` for `A`).
  - In LE, the least significant byte is stored first (`41 00` for `A`).
- **BOM**:  
  - The BOM distinguishes the byte order for proper decoding (`FE FF` for BE and `FF FE` for LE).

---

### **Notes on BOM Usage**
1. The BOM is **optional** in UTF-16 BE or LE files if the encoding and byte order are already known by the program reading the file.
2. Without a BOM:
   - A UTF-16 BE or LE file would require external metadata or assumptions to determine its byte order.
   - Misinterpretation could result in garbled text.

---

### **Conclusion**
In both UTF-16 BE and LE:
- The BOM appears **only once** at the start of the file.
- It is used to identify the encoding format and the byte order.
- It does **not** repeat before every character.

# No, in **UTF-16 BE (Big Endian)** and **UTF-16 LE (Little Endian)**, the **BOM (Byte Order Mark)** is **not added before every character**. It is only included **once at the very beginning of the file**.

---

### **Details**
1. **Purpose of BOM:**
   - The BOM (represented by `U+FEFF`) is used at the start of the file to indicate:
     - **The file's byte order**: Big Endian (`FE FF`) or Little Endian (`FF FE`).
     - **The encoding type**: UTF-16 in this case.

2. **Usage:**
   - The BOM is written at the **beginning of the file** as a marker and does not precede every character in the file.
   - After the BOM, the rest of the characters in the file are encoded normally in UTF-16 BE or LE, depending on the byte order.

---

### **Example:**
If the file contains the text `AB` (characters with Unicode code points `U+0041` and `U+0042`):

1. **UTF-16 BE:**
   - BOM: `FE FF` (Big Endian marker).
   - Character `A`: `00 41`.
   - Character `B`: `00 42`.
   - Byte sequence:
     ```
     FE FF 00 41 00 42
     ```

2. **UTF-16 LE:**
   - BOM: `FF FE` (Little Endian marker).
   - Character `A`: `41 00`.
   - Character `B`: `42 00`.
   - Byte sequence:
     ```
     FF FE 41 00 42 00
     ```

---

### **Why the BOM is Not Repeated:**
- The BOM is **a metadata marker for the file**. Its job is to define the encoding and byte order for the entire file.
- Once the BOM is processed, the remaining data is interpreted according to the specified byte order (BE or LE). Repeating the BOM before every character would be redundant and inefficient.

### **Conclusion:**
In **UTF-16 BE** and **UTF-16 LE**, the BOM appears **only once at the start of the file**. It does **not** repeat before every character.

Let's consider the example **"apple is good for health"** encoded in **UTF-16 BE** and **UTF-16 LE** with and without a BOM:

---

### **Text:**  
`apple is good for health`

### **Encoding in UTF-16**

1. **Characters in Unicode (Code Points):**
   - `a` → `U+0061`  
   - `p` → `U+0070`  
   - `l` → `U+006C`  
   - `e` → `U+0065`  
   - Space → `U+0020`  
   - `i` → `U+0069`  
   - `s` → `U+0073`  
   - `g` → `U+0067`  
   - `o` → `U+006F`  
   - `d` → `U+0064`  
   - `f` → `U+0066`  
   - `o` → `U+006F`  
   - `r` → `U+0072`  
   - Space → `U+0020`  
   - `h` → `U+0068`  
   - `e` → `U+0065`  
   - `a` → `U+0061`  
   - `l` → `U+006C`  
   - `t` → `U+0074`  
   - `h` → `U+0068`

### **Key Takeaways:**
1. The **BOM (`FE FF` or `FF FE`)** is included **only once at the beginning of the file** to indicate the byte order.
2. After the BOM, each character is encoded as **2 bytes** in the specified byte order:
   - **Big Endian:** Higher-order byte first (e.g., `00 61` for `a`).
   - **Little Endian:** Lower-order byte first (e.g., `61 00` for `a`).
3. Without a BOM, the byte order must be determined by external context or assumed based on system conventions.
