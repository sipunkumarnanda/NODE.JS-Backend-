Sure! Let's break down how the **`new` keyword** and **`prototype` linking** work behind the scenes by mimicking the behavior step by step.

### **How `new` Keyword and Prototype Linkage Work Behind the Scenes**

When you use the `new` keyword, it performs several steps internally, including linking the newly created object to the constructor function's prototype. We'll mimic this process step-by-step using basic JavaScript and comments to understand what's going on behind the scenes.

### Step 1: Constructor Function

Let's start by defining a simple constructor function:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
```

### Step 2: Mimicking `new` keyword behavior

The `new` keyword does the following behind the scenes:

1. It creates a new, empty object (`obj`).
2. It sets the **`[[Prototype]]`** of the new object to the `Person.prototype` object.
3. It calls the `Person` constructor function with the new object (`this`) as its context.
4. It automatically returns the new object (`obj`).

### Mimicking the steps behind `new`:

We'll mimic these steps manually:

```javascript
// Mimic the `new` keyword mechanism step by step

// Step 1: Create an empty object
const obj = {};

// Step 2: Link the object's prototype to Person.prototype
Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, Person.prototype);

// Step 3: Call the constructor function with `this` set to the newly created object
Person.call(obj, "John", 30);

// Now `obj` has the properties set by the constructor
console.log(obj); // { name: 'John', age: 30 }
```

Here, `Person.call(obj, "John", 30)` is like saying `new Person("John", 30)` because we manually set the context (`this`) to the newly created object.

### Step 3: Accessing Properties and Methods from the Prototype

Now that `obj` is linked to `Person.prototype`, it can access the properties and methods defined on `Person.prototype`. Let’s define a method on the `Person.prototype` and see how the newly created object can access it.

```javascript
// Step 4: Add a method to the prototype of Person
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

// Step 5: The new object (obj) can now call greet() from the prototype
obj.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

### Step 4: What Happens Behind the Scenes with `[[Prototype]]`

To understand how the method `greet` is accessed, let's dive into the **`[[Prototype]]`**:

- When you call `obj.greet()`, JavaScript looks for the `greet` method on the `obj` object first.
- Since `obj` doesn't have `greet` as its own property, it checks the **`[[Prototype]]** of `obj`, which points to `Person.prototype`.
- Since `greet` is defined on `Person.prototype`, it is available for `obj` to use.

### Step 5: The Complete Process in Action

Here’s the entire flow, all together:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Mimic `new` keyword behavior step-by-step
const obj = {}; // Step 1: Create an empty object
Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, Person.prototype); // Step 2: Link to Person.prototype

Person.call(obj, "John", 30); // Step 3: Call constructor with `this` pointing to `obj`

// Step 4: Add method to Person prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

obj.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

### **Conclusion**:

- The `new` keyword creates an empty object.
- The object's **`[[Prototype]]`** is linked to the constructor's prototype (in this case, `Person.prototype`).
- The constructor function is called with the object as `this`, and properties are set on it.
- The object can access methods and properties from the constructor's **`prototype`** because of the **prototype chain**.

You're on the right track! Let's clarify it a bit further:

When we use the `new` keyword in JavaScript, here's what happens step-by-step:

1. **New Object Creation:**  
   A new empty object is created. This is typically represented as `obj = {}`.

2. **Prototype Linking:**  
   The new object is linked to the constructor function's `prototype`. This is where your understanding comes in:
   - The `[[Prototype]]` (internal property) of `obj` is set to `Person.prototype`.  
   - This means that `obj` will have access to all the properties and methods defined on `Person.prototype`.

   It isn't quite like `emptyObj.prototype.Person.prototype`. Rather, it's more like this:
   ```js
   obj.__proto__ = Person.prototype;
   ```

3. **Constructor Function Call:**  
   The `Person` constructor is called, and within it, the `this` keyword refers to the newly created object (`obj`). So, if you set properties inside the `Person` constructor, those properties are added to `obj`.

4. **Returning the Object:**  
   After the constructor function runs, the new object (`obj`) is returned (unless the constructor explicitly returns a different object).

### Let's break this down with an example:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

// Step 1: The new keyword creates an empty object
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 25);

// Step 2: The new object's prototype is linked to Person.prototype
console.log(person1.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true

// Step 3: The constructor function sets properties on the new object
console.log(person1.name);  // Alice
console.log(person1.age);   // 25

// Step 4: The new object is returned and we can access its methods
person1.sayHello();  // Hello, my name is Alice
```

### How it works:
- When `new Person('Alice', 25)` is executed, the steps I mentioned happen:
  - An empty object is created.
  - The object's prototype is set to `Person.prototype`.
  - The `Person` constructor is invoked, and the `this` inside the constructor refers to the new object.
  - The `name` and `age` properties are added to the object, and the method `sayHello` is inherited from `Person.prototype`.
  - Finally, the new object (`person1`) is returned.

This process is why you can access both the `name`, `age` (properties set inside the constructor), and `sayHello` (method inherited from `Person.prototype`) on the object created with the `new` keyword.

So, to clarify:
- `emptyObj.prototype.Person.prototype` is a bit misleading. It's more like: `obj.__proto__ = Person.prototype`, where `obj` is the new object, and `Person.prototype` is the prototype linked to that object.
