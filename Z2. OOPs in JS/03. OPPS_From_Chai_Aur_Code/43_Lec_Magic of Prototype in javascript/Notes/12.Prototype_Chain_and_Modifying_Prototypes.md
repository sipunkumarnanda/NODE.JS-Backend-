### Detailed Notes on Prototypes, Inheritance, and Object Modification in JavaScript

#### 1. **Prototype Inheritance**
In JavaScript, **prototype inheritance** allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

- **`Object.prototype`** is the prototype of all objects, and methods added to it are inherited by all objects.
- **Array.prototype** is the prototype for all arrays and includes built-in array methods, but you can add custom methods too.
- **Custom objects** can inherit properties and methods from other objects via the `__proto__` property or `Object.setPrototypeOf()`.

##### Example: Adding methods to prototypes

```javascript
Object.prototype.hitesh = function(){
    console.log(`Hitesh is present in all objects`);
}

Array.prototype.heyHitesh = function(){
    console.log(`Hitesh says hello`);
}

let myHeros = ["thor", "spiderman"];
let heroPower = {
    thor: "hammer",
    spiderman: "sling",
    getSpiderPower: function() {
        console.log(`Spidy power is ${this.spiderman}`);
    }
}

// Calling methods from prototypes
myHeros.heyHitesh(); // "Hitesh says hello"
heroPower.hitesh();  // "Hitesh is present in all objects"
```

- **`Object.prototype.hitesh`** is available to all objects. When you call `heroPower.hitesh()`, it prints the message.
- **`Array.prototype.heyHitesh`** is added to all arrays. So, `myHeros.heyHitesh()` works as expected.

#### 2. **Prototype Chain & Inheritance Between Objects**
Objects can inherit from other objects, which creates a **prototype chain**. By modifying an object's `__proto__` property or using `Object.setPrototypeOf()`, one can establish inheritance.

##### Example: Setting up Inheritance

```javascript
const User = {
    name: "chai",
    email: "chai@google.com"
}

const Teacher = {
    makeVideo: true
}

const TeachingSupport = {
    isAvailable: false
}

const TASupport = {
    makeAssignment: 'JS assignment',
    fullTime: true,
    __proto__: TeachingSupport
}

Teacher.__proto__ = User; // Teacher inherits from User

Object.setPrototypeOf(TeachingSupport, Teacher); // Modern way to set prototype chain
```

- In the example, `Teacher` inherits from `User` using `__proto__`.
- Similarly, `TeachingSupport` is linked to `Teacher`, and thus inherits from it.

##### Inheritance Flow:
- `TASupport` can access properties from both `TeachingSupport` and `Teacher` because of the prototype chain.
- If `TASupport` does not have a property, JavaScript will search for it in `TeachingSupport`, and if not found, will continue searching in `Teacher` and `User`.

---

#### 3. **Modifying Built-in Prototypes**
In JavaScript, you can add your own methods to existing objects by modifying their prototypes.

##### Example: Modifying `String.prototype` and `Array.prototype`

```javascript
String.prototype.trueLength = function(){
    console.log(`${this}`);
    console.log(`True length is: ${this.trim().length}`);
}

let anotherUsername = "ChaiAurCode     ";
anotherUsername.trueLength(); // "True length is: 13"

"hitesh".trueLength(); // "True length is: 6"
"iceTea".trueLength(); // "True length is: 6"
```

- **Modifying `String.prototype`**: A new method `trueLength` is added to `String` to calculate the length after trimming whitespace.
- This allows **any string** to use the `trueLength()` method.

#### 4. **Prototype Chain Behind the Scenes**
When an object tries to access a property, JavaScript looks for it in the object. If the property isn't found, it searches through the object's prototype chain, moving up the chain of objects until the property is found or `null` is reached.

##### Example: Accessing Properties Using Prototype Chain

```javascript
const User = {
    name: "chai",
    email: "chai@google.com"
}

const Teacher = {
    makeVideo: true
}

Teacher.__proto__ = User; // Teacher inherits from User

const newTeacher = new Teacher();
console.log(newTeacher.name);  // "chai" from User (inherited)
console.log(newTeacher.makeVideo);  // true
```

---

#### 5. **`Object.setPrototypeOf()`**
`Object.setPrototypeOf()` is a method that allows setting or changing the prototype of an object.

##### Example:
```javascript
Object.setPrototypeOf(TeachingSupport, Teacher);
```

- This method is used to explicitly set the prototype of one object (`TeachingSupport`) to another object (`Teacher`).

### Summary of Key Points

1. **Prototype Inheritance**: Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype.
2. **Prototype Modification**: You can add new methods to the prototype of built-in objects (like `Array`, `String`, `Object`).
3. **`Object.setPrototypeOf()`**: Dynamically changes the prototype of an object.
4. **Prototype Chain**: If a property isn't found in an object, JavaScript checks the prototype chain until the property is found or it reaches `null`.
5. **`new` Keyword**: The `new` keyword automatically sets the prototype of the new object to the constructor function's prototype.

Your understanding is almost correct, but let's clarify the difference between `__proto__` and `prototype` with respect to inheritance and object behavior in JavaScript:

### **`__proto__`**:
- `__proto__` is used to **link** an object to its **prototype**.
- It refers to the internal prototype of an object (i.e., the object that is linked to the prototype chain).
- It allows an object to inherit properties and methods from its prototype.

**Use case**: Setting or accessing the prototype of an existing object.

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Sipun" };
const person = { greet: function() { console.log("Hello, " + this.name); } };

// Link obj to person, making obj inherit from person
obj.__proto__ = person;

obj.greet(); // Output: "Hello, Sipun" (Inherits from person)
```

In this case, `obj` inherits the `greet` method from `person` via `__proto__`.

### **`prototype`**:
- `prototype` is a property of **constructor functions** (functions used as constructors for objects created with `new`).
- It is used to **define properties and methods** that should be available to all objects created by that constructor function.

**Use case**: Adding properties or methods to the constructor's prototype so that all instances created by that constructor can access them.

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
};

const person1 = new Person("Sipun");
const person2 = new Person("Ankita");

person1.greet(); // Output: "Hello, Sipun"
person2.greet(); // Output: "Hello, Ankita"
```

Here, `greet` is added to the `Person.prototype`, so all instances created by `Person` can access it.

### **Key Differences**:

1. **`__proto__`**:
   - Refers to the prototype of a **specific object**.
   - Used for inheritance, i.e., to link one object to another object's prototype.
   - It allows an object to inherit properties and methods from a prototype chain.

2. **`prototype`**:
   - Is a property of **constructor functions**.
   - Used to **define** properties or methods on the prototype of a function, which will be available to all objects created using that constructor.

### Summary:
- **`__proto__`** is used to link an object to its prototype (inheritance).
- **`prototype`** is used to define methods or properties on a constructor function's prototype, making them accessible to all instances of that constructor.

This is the core distinction between the two.
