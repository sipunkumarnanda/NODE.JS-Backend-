### Behind-the-Scenes Explanation of the `new` Keyword Mechanism

When using the `new` keyword, JavaScript performs a sequence of operations behind the scenes to create and initialize an object. Here's how it works in detail:

#### Code Example:
```javascript
function createUser(username, score) {
    this.username = username;  // Add `username` to the new object.
    this.score = score;        // Add `score` to the new object.
    console.log(this);         // Log the newly created object.
}

createUser.prototype.printMe = function () {
    console.log(`Score is ${this.score}`);
};

// Using the `new` keyword
const chai = new createUser("Chai", 25);

// Behind the scenes:
const emptyObj = {};
Object.setPrototypeOf(emptyObj, createUser.prototype); // Link to the prototype.
createUser.call(emptyObj, "Chai", 25); // Call the function with `this` set to emptyObj.

console.log(emptyObj); // Logs: createUser { username: 'Chai', score: 25 }
emptyObj.printMe();    // Logs: "Score is 25"
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation of `new`:
When you do:

```javascript
const chai = new createUser("Chai", 25);
```

JavaScript performs the following steps internally:

1. **Create an Empty Object:**
   ```javascript
   const emptyObj = {};
   ```
   - An empty object is created to hold the properties of the new object.

2. **Link to the Prototype:**
   ```javascript
   Object.setPrototypeOf(emptyObj, createUser.prototype);
   ```
   - The new object’s `[[Prototype]]` (or `__proto__`) is linked to the `prototype` property of the constructor function (`createUser.prototype`).

3. **Set `this` to the New Object:**
   ```javascript
   createUser.call(emptyObj, "Chai", 25);
   ```
   - The `createUser` function is executed in the context of `emptyObj`. 
   - The `this` inside `createUser` now refers to `emptyObj`.
   - Properties like `username` and `score` are added to `emptyObj`.

4. **Implicit Return of the Object:**
   - If no other object is explicitly returned from the constructor, the newly created object (`emptyObj`) is returned by default.

   ```javascript
   return emptyObj; // Implicitly done by JavaScript.
   ```

---

### Result:
- The `chai` object now contains the properties `username` and `score` and has access to the methods defined on `createUser.prototype`.

#### Example:
```javascript
chai.printMe(); // Logs: "Score is 25"
```
This works because:
1. `chai` has its prototype linked to `createUser.prototype`.
2. The `printMe` method is defined on `createUser.prototype`.

---

### Common Pitfall Without `new`:
If `createUser` is called without `new`, the `this` inside the function will refer to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode). The prototype linking and property assignment won’t occur correctly.

#### Example:
```javascript
const chai = createUser("Chai", 25); 
// `this` refers to the global object, not a newly created one.
// This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
```

To avoid this issue, always use `new` when calling a constructor function.
