### **Detailed Notes: Why `chai.printMe()` Throws a TypeError**

#### **Problem Statement**
When invoking the `createUser` function without the `new` keyword, the `chai` object does not inherit the `printMe` method from `createUser.prototype`. As a result, calling `chai.printMe()` leads to a `TypeError`.

#### **Code in Question**

```javascript
function createUser(username, score) {
    this.username = username;
    this.score = score;

    console.log(this);
    return this;
}

createUser.prototype.printMe = function () {
    console.log(`Score is ${this.score}`);
};

// Throws TypeError
chai.printMe(); // chai.printMe is not a function
```

#### **Root Cause**

1. **Function Invocation Without `new`**
   - When `createUser` is invoked as a normal function (`createUser()`), the `this` keyword:
     - Refers to the **global object** (`window` in browsers or `global` in Node.js), or
     - Is `undefined` if running in strict mode.
   - The returned object (or implicit `this`) is not linked to `createUser.prototype`.

2. **Prototype Chain Is Not Established**
   - In JavaScript, methods defined on the constructor's prototype (e.g., `createUser.prototype.printMe`) are available only to objects created via the constructor function using the `new` keyword.
   - Since `chai` was not created using `new createUser()`, it is not linked to `createUser.prototype`, and thus does not inherit the `printMe` method.

3. **TypeError**
   - The attempt to call `chai.printMe()` fails because `chai` does not have access to the `printMe` method, resulting in a `TypeError`.

#### **Solution**

To resolve the issue, always use the `new` keyword when creating an object from a constructor function. This ensures the prototype chain is set up correctly.

##### **Corrected Code**

```javascript
function createUser(username, score) {
    this.username = username;
    this.score = score;

    console.log(this);
    return this;
}

createUser.prototype.printMe = function () {
    console.log(`Score is ${this.score}`);
};

// Using `new` to create an instance
const chai = new createUser("Chai", 25); 
chai.printMe(); // Output: Score is 25
```

#### **How It Works**

1. **The `new` Keyword Mechanism**
   - When you use `new createUser("Chai", 25)`, the following steps occur:
     1. A new empty object is created: `{}`.
     2. The `[[Prototype]]` of the new object is linked to `createUser.prototype`.
     3. The `this` keyword inside `createUser` refers to this newly created object.
     4. The properties (`username` and `score`) are added to the object.
     5. The new object is implicitly returned (unless another object is explicitly returned).

2. **Prototype Chain Is Established**
   - The `chai` object inherits from `createUser.prototype`, so the `printMe` method is accessible to `chai`.

#### **Explaining the TypeError in Original Code**

1. **Original Code**
   ```javascript
   const chai = createUser("Chai", 25);
   chai.printMe(); // TypeError: chai.printMe is not a function
   ```

2. **What Happens Here?**
   - `createUser` is called without `new`, so `this` inside the function refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).
   - Properties like `username` and `score` are assigned to the global object.
   - `chai` is `undefined` in strict mode or points to the global object, which does not have access to `createUser.prototype.printMe`.

---

#### **Best Practices**

1. **Always Use `new` with Constructor Functions**
   - To ensure the object is properly linked to the constructorâ€™s prototype.

2. **Constructor Function Naming Convention**
   - Use PascalCase (e.g., `CreateUser`) for constructor functions to distinguish them from regular functions.

3. **Use Classes for Better Syntax**
   - Modern JavaScript uses `class` syntax for object creation and inheritance, which is more readable and eliminates confusion with `new`.

##### **Class Equivalent Code**

```javascript
class User {
    constructor(username, score) {
        this.username = username;
        this.score = score;
    }

    printMe() {
        console.log(`Score is ${this.score}`);
    }
}

const chai = new User("Chai", 25);
chai.printMe(); // Output: Score is 25
```

---

#### **Summary**
- The `TypeError` occurs because the function was called without `new`, so the prototype chain was not established.
- The `new` keyword ensures that:
  - A new object is created.
  - The `this` inside the constructor refers to the new object.
  - The new object inherits from the constructor's prototype.
- Using `class` syntax is a modern and cleaner approach to avoid such issues.
