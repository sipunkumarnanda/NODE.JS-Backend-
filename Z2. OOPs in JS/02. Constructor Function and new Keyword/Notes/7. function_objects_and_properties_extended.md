### **Detailed Notes: Understanding Function Objects and Properties**

#### **1. Functions as Objects**
In JavaScript, functions are **first-class objects**, meaning they can:
- Be assigned properties (like any other object).
- Contain other objects or methods as properties.

In the given code:
```javascript
function hello() {}
```
The `hello` function is a callable object, so you can attach properties, objects, or methods to it.

---

#### **2. Adding Properties to a Function**
Here, the function `hello` is assigned the property `p1`:
```javascript
hello.p1 = "Ankita";
```
- `p1` is a custom property added to the function object.
- This does not affect the behavior of the `hello` function itself but adds metadata to it.

You can access this property like any object property:
```javascript
console.log(hello.p1); // Output: "Ankita"
```

---

#### **3. Adding an Object as a Property**
You can also assign an entire object as a property of a function:
```javascript
hello.obj3 = {
    name: "Sipun",
    age: 22
};
```
- The `obj3` property contains an object with its own properties `name` and `age`.
- Accessing this property:
```javascript
console.log(hello.obj3); // Output: { name: 'Sipun', age: 22 }
```

---

#### **4. Adding a Method as a Property**
Here, an object with a method (`greet`) is added as a property of the `hello` function:
```javascript
hello.func = {
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello I am Greet Function And Heyy Hello ${this.name1}`);
    }
};
```
- `func` is an object that contains the method `greet`.
- Accessing `func`:
```javascript
console.log(hello.func); // Output: { greet: [Function: greet] }
```
- Accessing `greet` itself:
```javascript
console.log(hello.func.greet); // Output: [Function: greet]
```
- **Note**: `this` in `greet` refers to the object from which it is called.

---

#### **5. Returning a New Object**
The `abc` function creates and returns a new object using the properties and methods of `hello`:
```javascript
function abc() {
    return obj = {
        name1: hello.p1,        // Accesses hello.p1 and assigns it to name1
        obj: hello.obj3,        // Accesses hello.obj3 and assigns it to obj
        func: hello.func.greet  // Assigns the greet method of hello.func
    };
}
```

**Key Details**:
- `abc` pulls data from `hello` and organizes it into a new object.
- Example usage:
```javascript
const result = abc();
console.log(result);
// Output:
// {
//   name1: 'Ankita',
//   obj: { name: 'Sipun', age: 22 },
//   func: [Function: greet]
// }
```

**Calling `func` in the returned object**:
If you try to call `result.func()`, it will throw an error unless you bind `this` to an appropriate object. This is because `this.name1` in `greet` is not defined in the `result` object.

### **6. Why This is Useful**
This pattern demonstrates the flexibility of JavaScript functions. You can:
1. Use functions as containers for related properties or methods.
2. Encapsulate data and functionality within a single callable object.
3. Return organized data and methods using other functions.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. Functions in JavaScript are objects and can store properties, objects, or methods.
2. Properties added to a function do not interfere with its callable nature.
3. Methods within objects attached to a function can use `this` if invoked with the correct context.
4. The `abc` function demonstrates a practical use case for organizing and returning function metadata.
