### **Explanation Behind the Scene**
```javascript
function abc(){
    return obj = {
        name1 : hello.p1 ,
        obj : hello.obj3 ,
        func : hello.func.greet
    }
}
```
### Let's break down the code and explain what happens behind the scenes, step-by-step:

```javascript
function abc(){
    return obj = {
        name1 : hello.p1 ,  // Its mean 
        name1 : "Ankita"   , hello.p1 = "Ankita"
        obj : hello.obj3 ,   // its mean 
        obj : {
            name : "Sipun" , 
            age : 22
        }
        func : hello.func.greet  // Its mean 
        func :  greet() {
            console.log(`Hello iam Greet Function And Heyy Hello ${this.name1}`);
        }
    }
}
```

### **1. `name1 : hello.p1`**

- **Behind the scenes:**  
   This line is creating a property `name1` in the object that is being returned by the `abc` function. The value of `name1` is being set to `hello.p1`.  
   - `hello.p1` was previously assigned the value `"Ankita"`.
   - **Result:** `name1` will be `"Ankita"`.

- **Key Insight:** The value `hello.p1` is being accessed and assigned as a property of the new object. The `hello.p1` is just a reference to a value stored on the `hello` function.

---

### **2. `obj : hello.obj3`**

- **Behind the scenes:**  
   This line is creating a property `obj` in the object returned by `abc`. The value of `obj` is being set to `hello.obj3`.  
   - `hello.obj3` was previously assigned an object:
     ```javascript
     hello.obj3 = {
        name: "Sipun",
        age: 22
     };
     ```
   - **Result:** The `obj` property in the new object will be an object with the properties `name` set to `"Sipun"` and `age` set to `22`.

- **Key Insight:** The object `hello.obj3` is being reused as a property in the new object returned by `abc`.

---

### **3. `func : hello.func.greet`**

- **Behind the scenes:**  
   This line is creating a property `func` in the object returned by `abc`. The value of `func` is being set to `hello.func.greet`.  
   - `hello.func.greet` was previously defined as a method:
     ```javascript
     hello.func = {
         greet() {
            console.log(`Hello I am Greet Function And Heyy Hello ${this.name1}`);
         }
     };
     ```
   - **Result:** `func` will be a reference to the `greet` function.

- **Key Insight:** The method `greet` is not directly copied but rather referenced, so you can call it using `func()` in the new object.

---

### **The Full `abc` Function**

Putting it all together, the `abc` function will return an object that looks like this:

```javascript
{
    name1: "Ankita",               // From hello.p1
    obj: {                          // From hello.obj3
        name: "Sipun",
        age: 22
    },
    func: function greet() {        // From hello.func.greet
        console.log(`Hello I am Greet Function And Heyy Hello ${this.name1}`);
    }
}
```

- **`name1`** is `"Ankita"`, which came from `hello.p1`.
- **`obj`** is an object containing `{ name: "Sipun", age: 22 }`, which came from `hello.obj3`.
- **`func`** is a reference to the `greet` function, which logs a greeting message using the `name1` property.

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Accessing and Reusing Existing Properties:** The values from the `hello` function are being accessed and reused in the object returned by `abc`.
2. **Properties Are Assigned by Reference:** For example, `hello.obj3` is an object, and when it's assigned to `obj` in the new object, it doesn't create a new copy but references the original `hello.obj3` object.
3. **Methods as References:** The method `greet` is assigned by reference to `func` in the new object, meaning it's not copied, but the reference to the original function is stored.

---

### **Summary**

The `abc` function returns an object with properties that pull values and references from the `hello` functionâ€™s properties. The properties like `hello.p1`, `hello.obj3`, and `hello.func.greet` are reused as they are, meaning they point to the original data and methods. This allows the returned object to have access to these values and functions, without modifying the original `hello` function.
