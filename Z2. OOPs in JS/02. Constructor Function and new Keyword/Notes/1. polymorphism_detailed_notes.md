### Notes on Polymorphism

#### **Definition of Polymorphism**
Polymorphism is a key principle in object-oriented programming that allows objects to take on multiple forms. It enables a single interface or method to operate on different types of data, making it possible for the same operation to behave differently depending on the context.

#### **How Polymorphism Works in JavaScript**

In JavaScript, polymorphism is commonly achieved through methods that are defined outside specific objects but are designed to work with any object that shares a certain structure or behavior.

---

#### **Example: Polymorphism in the Given Code**

In the provided code:

```javascript
function getBirthYear() {
  return new Date().getFullYear() - this.age;
}  // By creating this function we achieve polymorphism 

function createUser(firstName, lastName, age) {
    const user = {
      firstName,
      lastName,
      age,
      getBirthYear 
    };
    return user;
}

const newObj = createUser("Ankitaa", "Kumari", 20);
console.log(newObj); // { firstName: 'Ankitaa', lastName: 'Kumari', age: 20 }
console.log(newObj.getBirthYear());  // 2005 

const newObj2 = createUser("Akankshya", "Das", 92);
console.log(newObj2.getBirthYear());  // 2003
```

---

#### **Polymorphism Explained in the Code**

1. **Shared Behavior**:
   - The `getBirthYear` function is defined once and shared across all objects created by the `createUser` function.
   - This function calculates the birth year based on the `age` property of the object it is invoked on.

2. **Dynamic `this` Binding**:
   - The `this` keyword in `getBirthYear` refers to the object on which the method is called.
   - This means that `getBirthYear` can work dynamically for any object with an `age` property, regardless of the specific object.

3. **Different Behavior for Different Objects**:
   - Even though the same function `getBirthYear` is used, it behaves differently based on the `age` property of the object invoking it.
   - For `newObj`, `this.age` is `20`, so it calculates `2005`.
   - For `newObj2`, `this.age` is `92`, so it calculates `2003`.

#### **Advantages of Polymorphism in This Code**
- **Code Reusability**:
  - The `getBirthYear` function is written once and reused across multiple objects without duplicating the logic.
  
- **Memory Efficiency**:
  - The function is not recreated for every object, saving memory.
  
- **Flexibility**:
  - The function works with any object that includes an `age` property, making it adaptable for various use cases.

---

#### **Key Takeaways**
- Polymorphism allows a single method, such as `getBirthYear`, to handle different objects dynamically.
- By leveraging the `this` keyword, the method adapts its behavior based on the object invoking it.
- This reduces redundancy, improves maintainability, and aligns with the principles of object-oriented programming.

#### **Real-World Analogy**
Imagine a universal key that works in different locks:
- The key (`getBirthYear`) can be used for any lock (`object`) as long as the lock fits the key's design (i.e., the object has the required structure, like the `age` property).
- Each lock will unlock differently depending on its unique structure (similar to how `this.age` varies across objects).

This adaptability is the essence of polymorphism!
