# Code Explanation 
```javascript
const obj = new createUser("Amrita") // When we invoke createUser function with new keyword an empty object {} is created and along with this empty object aruments like here "Amrita" is pass to the function and insdie that function this refer to the {} empty object and by this.firstName = "Amrita" set to the object now object has {firstName : "Amrita"} and implicitly return to where invoked 
console.log(obj);  // createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' }
console.log(obj.firstName)

function createUser(firstName, lastName, age){
    this.firstName = firstName
    console.log(this);
}
```

# Yes, your explanation is mostly accurate and aligns with how JavaScript works with the `new` keyword. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of How `new createUser("Amrita")` Works:**

1. **Creation of a New Object:**
   When you invoke the `createUser` function with the `new` keyword:
   - A new empty object `{}` is created by JavaScript.
   - This object is internally linked to the prototype of the constructor function (`createUser.prototype`).

2. **`this` Binding:**
   Inside the `createUser` function:
   - The `this` keyword automatically refers to the newly created empty object.
   - Any properties or methods assigned to `this` become part of that object.

3. **Passing Arguments:**
   The arguments passed to the `createUser` function (in this case, `"Amrita"`) are accessible inside the function.
   - The line `this.firstName = firstName` assigns `"Amrita"` to the `firstName` property of the new object.

4. **Implicit Return:**
   If the function does not explicitly return an object, JavaScript implicitly returns the newly created object.
   - This is why `obj` becomes `createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' }`.

5. **Resulting Object:**
   The resulting object (`obj`) now has:
   - The `firstName` property set to `"Amrita"`.
   - The constructor name (`createUser`) is shown in the console when you log `obj`.

### **How Your Code Works:**

```javascript
function createUser(firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName; // Sets the firstName property on the new object
    console.log(this); // Logs the newly created object with the firstName property
}

const obj = new createUser("Amrita"); // Creates a new object and assigns "Amrita" to firstName
console.log(obj);  // Logs: createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' }
console.log(obj.firstName); // Logs: Amrita
```

---

### **Clarifications:**

- **Yes, your explanation is correct:**
   - The `new` keyword creates a new object, binds `this` to that object, and implicitly returns it unless you explicitly return another object.
   
- **Key Point:**
   - The `console.log(obj)` output showing `createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' }` is due to the object being created by the `createUser` constructor function. The constructor's name is shown as part of the object's type in the console (browser/Node.js behavior).

# The **empty object** that appears inside the function when you use the `new` keyword is automatically created by JavaScript as part of how the `new` operator works. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### **Where the Empty Object Comes From:**

1. **The Role of the `new` Keyword:**
   - When you invoke a function with the `new` keyword, JavaScript performs these operations under the hood:
     1. **Create an empty object.**  
        ```javascript
        const obj = {}; // Automatically created
        ```
     2. **Set the prototype of this object to the constructor's prototype.**  
        ```javascript
        Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, ConstructorFunction.prototype);
        ```
     3. **Bind `this` inside the function to the new object.**  
        ```javascript
        this = obj; // Inside the constructor
        ```
     4. **Return the object if the function does not explicitly return an object.**  
        ```javascript
        return this; // Implicit
        ```

2. **Why Does `this` Refer to the Empty Object?**
   - In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the context in which a function is called.  
     - When a function is called using the `new` keyword, `this` is set to the newly created object.

3. **What Happens Inside the Function?**
   - You can now use `this` to add properties and methods to the object:
     ```javascript
     function createUser(firstName) {
         this.firstName = firstName; // Adds the firstName property to the new object
     }
     ```

4. **Returning the Object:**
   - If the function does not explicitly return an object, the new object (`this`) is implicitly returned.

---

### **Example (Step-by-Step Simulation):**

```javascript
function createUser(firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName; // 'this' refers to the new empty object
    console.log(this); // Logs the new object
}

const obj = new createUser("Amrita");
```

Hereâ€™s what happens under the hood when you invoke `new createUser("Amrita")`:

1. **Step 1: Create an Empty Object:**
   ```javascript
   const obj = {};
   ```

2. **Step 2: Link the Object to the Constructor's Prototype:**
   ```javascript
   Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, createUser.prototype);
   ```

3. **Step 3: Bind `this` to the Object:**
   ```javascript
   this = obj;
   ```

4. **Step 4: Execute the Constructor Code:**
   ```javascript
   this.firstName = "Amrita"; // Adds firstName property to the new object
   ```

5. **Step 5: Implicitly Return the Object:**
   ```javascript
   return this; // This is done automatically
   ```

6. **Final Result:**
   ```javascript
   obj = { firstName: "Amrita" };
   ```

---

### **Clarification with Example:**

```javascript
function createUser(firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName; // 'this' refers to the new empty object
    console.log(this); // Logs: { firstName: 'Amrita' }
}

const obj = new createUser("Amrita");
console.log(obj); // Logs: createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' }
```

- `console.log(this)` inside the function shows the newly created object with `firstName: 'Amrita'`.
- `console.log(obj)` shows the final object returned by the function, labeled as `createUser` because the constructor function created it.

---

If you explicitly return something other than an object, the empty object will not be returned:

```javascript
function createUser(firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName; // Still sets firstName
    return 42; // Explicitly returns a primitive
}

const obj = new createUser("Amrita");
console.log(obj); // Logs: createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' } because primitives are ignored
```

---

If you explicitly return an object, it overrides the default behavior:

```javascript
function createUser(firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName; // Still sets firstName
    return { name: "Override" }; // Explicitly returns an object
}

const obj = new createUser("Amrita");
console.log(obj); // Logs: { name: 'Override' }
```
