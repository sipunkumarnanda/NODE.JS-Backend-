# Optimizing Shared Methods in Factory Functions with commonMethods

### The term `commonMethods` refers to an object that holds methods or functions that are shared among all instances of a particular class or function. In the context of the code you provided, `commonMethods` is an object attached to the `createUser` function, and it contains methods (like `getBirthYear`) that will be used by the `user` objects created by `createUser`.

### Here's how `commonMethods` works:

- **`commonMethods` as a container for shared functions**:
  - The `createUser` function creates individual user objects, but instead of defining functions like `getBirthYear` directly inside each user object, we define them in a shared place called `commonMethods`.
  - This helps save memory by ensuring that every user object does not have its own copy of the `getBirthYear` function.

### Example Breakdown:
1. **Defining `commonMethods`**:  
   We attach `commonMethods` to the `createUser` function itself, meaning it's not part of the user objects, but it's shared across all of them.

   ```js
   createUser.commonMethods = {
     getBirthYear() {
       return new Date().getFullYear() - this.age;  // Method to calculate birth year
     }
   };
   ```

   - This creates a shared object called `commonMethods` where the `getBirthYear` method is stored.

2. **Using the `commonMethods` in user objects**:  
   Inside the `createUser` function, when we create a new user object, we don't define `getBirthYear` within the object itself. Instead, we reference the shared method from `commonMethods`.

   ```js
   const user = {
     firstName,
     lastName,
     age,
     getBirthYear: createUser.commonMethods.getBirthYear  // Reference to shared method
   };
   ```

   - Now, the `getBirthYear` function is available to all user objects but is shared from the `createUser.commonMethods` object.

3. **Why this is helpful**:
   - **Memory Efficiency**: Since the method is defined once in `commonMethods`, itâ€™s not duplicated for every user object, saving memory.
   - **Reusability**: If we need to change how `getBirthYear` works, we only need to update it in one place (`createUser.commonMethods`), and all user objects will reflect the change automatically.

### Example Code:

```js
// Defining commonMethods for shared functions
createUser.commonMethods = {
  getBirthYear() {
    return new Date().getFullYear() - this.age;  // Calculate birth year
  }
};

// Function to create a user, using the shared method
function createUser(firstName, lastName, age) {
  const user = {
    firstName,
    lastName,
    age,
    getBirthYear: createUser.commonMethods.getBirthYear  // Reference shared method
  };
  return user;
}

// Create a new user
const newUser = createUser("John", "Doe", 25);
console.log(newUser.getBirthYear());  // Shared method used
```

### Summary:
- **`commonMethods`** is a container for methods that are shared across all instances.
- Instead of defining methods in every individual object, we place them in `commonMethods` and refer to them, thus reducing memory usage and making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
