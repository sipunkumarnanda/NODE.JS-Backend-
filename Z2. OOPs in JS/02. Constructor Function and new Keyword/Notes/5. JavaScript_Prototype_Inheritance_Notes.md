### **Notes on Object Creation, Inheritance, and Prototypes in JavaScript**

---

#### **1. Why is the inherited method (`xyz2`) not shown when logging the object?**

**Explanation:**
- When you log an object using `console.log()`, only its **own properties** are shown. 
- **Inherited properties** (methods or properties that come from the prototype chain) are not listed in the object's own properties. 
- In your example, `xyz2` is an **inherited method** from the `userMethods` prototype, so it is not directly part of `obj3`'s own properties.

**Code:**
```javascript
const userMethods = {
    xyz2() {
        console.log(`This is xyz! And my name is ${this.name}, and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
};

function sayHi2(name, age) {
    const obj = Object.create(userMethods);
    obj.age = age;
    obj.name = name;
    return obj;
}

const obj3 = sayHi2("Ankita", 19);
console.log(obj3); // Logs: { age: 19, name: 'Ankita' }
```

#### **2. How can I access the inherited methods from the prototype?**

**Solution 1: Access the method directly**
- You can **invoke** the method directly using `obj3.xyz2()`. This will call the method `xyz2` from the `userMethods` prototype.

**Code:**
```javascript
obj3.xyz2(); // Logs: "This is xyz! And my name is Ankita, and I am 19 years old."
```

---

**Solution 2: Access the prototype**
- You can use `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj3)` to access the **prototype** of `obj3`, which will include inherited methods like `xyz2`.

**Code:**
```javascript
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj3)); // Logs: { xyz2: [Function: xyz2] }
```

---

#### **3. Why does `Object.create()` work to set up inheritance?**

**Explanation:**
- `Object.create()` creates a new object that **inherits** properties and methods from the prototype object passed to it. 
- In your case, `obj` inherits the method `xyz2` from `userMethods` but has its own `name` and `age` properties.

**Code:**
```javascript
const obj = Object.create(userMethods);
```

---

#### **4. What are own properties vs. inherited properties?**

**Own Properties:**
- These are the properties that are **directly** assigned to an object. They are specific to that object and are shown when logging the object.

**Inherited Properties:**
- These are properties that an object **inherits** from its prototype. They are not directly on the object but are accessible through the prototype chain.

**Code Example of Both:**
```javascript
const userMethods = {
    xyz2() {
        console.log(`This is xyz! And my name is ${this.name}, and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
};

function sayHi2(name, age) {
    const obj = Object.create(userMethods);
    obj.age = age;
    obj.name = name;
    return obj;
}

const obj3 = sayHi2("Ankita", 19);
console.log(obj3); // Logs: { age: 19, name: 'Ankita' } -- Own properties
obj3.xyz2(); // Logs: "This is xyz! And my name is Ankita, and I am 19 years old." -- Inherited method
```

---

#### **5. How to see all properties (own and inherited) of an object?**

- You can use `for...in` loop to iterate through both **own properties** and **inherited properties** of an object.

**Example:**
```javascript
for (let key in obj3) {
    console.log(key); // Logs both own and inherited properties
}
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **`console.log(obj)`** shows only the **own properties** of the object, not inherited ones.
- To access inherited methods, either invoke them directly (`obj3.xyz2()`) or access the prototype using `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj3)`.
- **`Object.create()`** is used to create objects with **inheritance** from a prototype object.
- **Own properties** are directly on the object, while **inherited properties** come from the object's prototype.
