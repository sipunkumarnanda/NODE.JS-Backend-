In JavaScript, the behavior of `this` is determined by how a function is called. When you call a function normally (like `sayHi()`), `this` refers to the global object or `undefined` (in strict mode). When you invoke a function with the `new` keyword (like `new sayHi()`), JavaScript creates a new instance of an object and sets `this` to that newly created object.

### Explanation:

1. **Calling `sayHi()` normally**: 
   ```javascript
   function sayHi() {
       console.log(this);
   }
   sayHi();
   ```
   - Here, `this` will refer to the **global object** (in browsers, that's `window`), because the function is called without the `new` keyword. In strict mode (`'use strict';`), `this` would be `undefined`.

2. **Calling `new sayHi()`**:
   ```javascript
   function sayHi() {
       console.log(this);
   }
   new sayHi();
   ```
   - When you call the function with the `new` keyword, JavaScript creates a new instance of an object and binds `this` to that new object. So in this case, `this` will be the new instance of the object.

### Summary:
- **Without `new`**: `this` refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).
- **With `new`**: `this` refers to the newly created object instance.

Yes, when you call a function using the `new` keyword in JavaScript, it returns an object. The process is known as creating an **instance** of a function or **constructor function**.

### Explanation:

When a function is called with the `new` keyword, JavaScript performs the following steps:
1. **Creates a new empty object.**
2. **Binds `this`** within the function to that new object.
3. **Sets the prototype of the new object** to the constructor function's `prototype`.
4. **Returns the new object** (unless the function explicitly returns another object).

### Example:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30); // Create an object with Person constructor

console.log(person1); 
// Output: Person { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
```

### Key points:
- The `new` keyword causes the function to behave like a **constructor function** that returns an object.
- If the constructor function does not explicitly return an object, the new instance (created object) is returned by default.
---

When you call a function with the `new` keyword in JavaScript, it behaves like a **constructor function** and creates a new object. However, when the function doesn't explicitly return an object, JavaScript automatically returns the newly created object.

In your example, since `sayHi()` doesn't explicitly return anything, the function still creates a new object, but the object is **not assigned any properties**. Thus, when you log `obj1`, you see `sayHi()` as the result, because `obj1` is essentially a blank object created by the constructor.

### Breakdown of what happens:

1. `new sayHi()` creates a new object (`obj1`).
2. Since there is no return statement in `sayHi()`, JavaScript implicitly returns the newly created object (`obj1`).
3. When you log `obj1`, you see the constructor function's name (`sayHi()`), because it refers to the constructor function that created the object.

### Example Code:

```javascript
function sayHi() {
    // Empty function, no return value
}

const obj1 = new sayHi(); // Creates a new object with sayHi() constructor
console.log(obj1);  // Outputs: sayHi {} (an empty object created by the constructor)
```

### Why it's logged as `sayHi()`:
- When you use `new`, the function creates a new object, but it doesn't explicitly define any properties or methods on it.
- The object created by `new` is essentially an empty object with the constructor function as its prototype. It doesn't have a `name` or `age` or any other properties.

To sum it up:
- The result `sayHi()` is just the default display of an object created by a constructor function (`sayHi`), which doesn't have any properties or methods added inside the function.
---
---
The difference you're observing in the behavior of the `new` keyword when calling the `sayHi()` function is due to the presence or absence of the `return` statement inside the function.

### Case 1: Without `return`
```javascript
function sayHi() {
    const obj1 = {
        name: "Obj1"
    };
    // No return statement here
}

const obj1 = new sayHi();
console.log(obj1); // Outputs: sayHi {}
```

- When you use `new sayHi()`, JavaScript automatically creates a new object (`obj1`) and sets `this` to that object. 
- Since the function does not explicitly return anything, JavaScript returns the newly created object by default, which is **empty** in this case because there are no properties assigned to the object.
- The `sayHi {}` in the output is showing that an object was created with the `sayHi` constructor, but it has no properties or methods added to it inside the function.
  
### Case 2: With `return`
```javascript
function sayHi() {
    const obj1 = {
        name: "Obj1"
    };
    return obj1; // Explicitly returning obj1
}

const obj1 = new sayHi();
console.log(obj1); // Outputs: { name: 'Obj1' }
```

- In this case, the function explicitly returns `obj1`, which is an object with the property `name: "Obj1"`.
- When you call `new sayHi()`, JavaScript still creates a new object, but this time, the function's return value (`obj1`) is returned instead of the newly created object.
- Since `obj1` is returned explicitly, the object returned from `new sayHi()` will have the properties defined in the `obj1` object, so you see `{ name: 'Obj1' }` in the output.

### Key Takeaways:

- When you call a function with `new`, JavaScript creates a new empty object and sets `this` to that object.
- If the function does not explicitly return an object, the new object created by `new` is returned by default, but it won't have any properties or methods unless they are set within the function.
- If the function explicitly returns an object, that object will be returned by the `new` keyword instead of the newly created empty object.

In conclusion:
- Without `return`, `new sayHi()` returns the new object created by JavaScript (which is empty).
- With `return`, the object you return (`obj1` in this case) will be returned by `new sayHi()`.

The reason why `createUser` appears before the object `{ firstName: 'Amrita' }` in the output of `console.log(obj);` is that it represents the **constructor function** that was used to create the object. This behavior is a feature of how JavaScript displays objects created using a constructor function in its console output.

---

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **The Constructor Name**  
   When an object is created using the `new` keyword, JavaScript internally associates the object with the constructor function that created it. The console shows this association by prepending the constructor function's name (`createUser`) to the object.

   ```javascript
   const obj = new createUser("Amrita");
   console.log(obj);
   // Output: createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' }
   ```

   - `createUser` here indicates the constructor function that was called with `new` to create the object.
   - `{ firstName: 'Amrita' }` represents the actual properties of the object.

2. **Why Does This Happen?**  
   JavaScript uses the `constructor` property of the object’s prototype to determine the name of the constructor function. When you call `new createUser()`, the following happens:
   - A new object is created.
   - The prototype of the object (`obj.__proto__`) is set to `createUser.prototype`.
   - The `constructor` property of `createUser.prototype` points back to the `createUser` function.

   This relationship allows the console to display the constructor's name (`createUser`) before the object.

   ```javascript
   console.log(obj.constructor.name); 
   // Output: createUser
   ```

3. **How JavaScript Displays Objects in the Console**  
   The console formats the object display for better readability and debugging. When an object is created with `new`, it includes the constructor name to provide context on how the object was created.

   - If you use a plain object literal, it doesn’t have a constructor name in its display:
     ```javascript
     const plainObj = { firstName: 'Amrita' };
     console.log(plainObj);
     // Output: { firstName: 'Amrita' }
     ```

   - If you use `new`, the constructor name appears:
     ```javascript
     function Person(name) {
         this.name = name;
     }
     const person = new Person('John');
     console.log(person);
     // Output: Person { name: 'John' }
     ```

4. **Modifying the Constructor Name**  
   The constructor name comes from the function’s name property. If you modify the function name or create an anonymous function, the behavior may differ:

   ```javascript
   const createUser = function(firstName) {
       this.firstName = firstName;
   };

   const obj = new createUser('Amrita');
   console.log(obj);
   // Output: createUser { firstName: 'Amrita' } (still works because `createUser` is a named function)

   // Anonymous function example
   const createUser2 = (function(firstName) {
       this.firstName = firstName;
   });
   const obj2 = new createUser2('John');
   console.log(obj2);
   // Output: Object { firstName: 'John' } (constructor name is not shown)
   ```

---

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Constructor Function Name**: When an object is created using `new`, the console prepends the constructor function name (e.g., `createUser`) to the object display.
2. **Prototype Relationship**: The constructor name is derived from the object’s prototype and its `constructor` property.
3. **Readable Debugging**: This formatting is for better debugging and helps identify which constructor function was used to create the object.
