# **Topic: Function Objects and Properties**

#### **1. Functions in JavaScript Are First-Class Objects**
Functions in JavaScript are considered **first-class objects**, which means:
- They can be assigned to variables.
- They can be passed as arguments to other functions.
- They can be returned from functions.
- Most importantly, they can have their own properties and methods.

#### **2. Adding Properties to a Function**
In JavaScript, a function is also an object. This allows us to add custom properties to it, just like we do with other objects. For example:
```javascript
function sayHi() {
    console.log("Hi!");
}

// Adding a property to the function
sayHi.name = "Sipun"; 

console.log(sayHi.name); // Output: "Sipun"
```

Here’s what happens:
- `sayHi` is both a callable function and an object.
- Adding `sayHi.name = "Sipun";` sets a custom property `name` on the function object.

#### **3. The Difference Between `name` and `sayHi.name`**
- The **`name` property** of a function object (without explicitly setting it) returns the function's **identifier** (its declared name). This is built into the function by default.
  Example:
  ```javascript
  function greet() {}
  console.log(greet.name); // Output: "greet"
  ```

- When you explicitly assign a value like `sayHi.name = "Sipun"`, you're overriding or adding a new custom property to the function object.

#### **4. Built-in Function Properties**
Functions in JavaScript also have built-in properties and methods, such as:
- `name`: Returns the name of the function (can be overwritten as shown).
- `length`: Indicates the number of expected arguments for the function.
- `call` and `apply`: Methods for calling the function with a specified `this` value.
- `bind`: Creates a new function with a specific `this` context.

Example:
```javascript
function exampleFunction(a, b) {}
console.log(exampleFunction.length); // Output: 2 (because it expects 2 arguments)
```

#### **5. Practical Use of Function Properties**
Function properties are often used for:
- **Metadata Storage**: Attaching additional information to a function, such as configuration details.
  Example:
  ```javascript
  function task() {
      console.log("Performing a task");
  }
  task.description = "This function performs a specific task.";
  console.log(task.description); // Output: "This function performs a specific task."
  ```
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Storing state or data directly within the function object.

#### **6. Key Points to Remember**
- Functions are objects in JavaScript and can store properties.
- Custom properties do not affect the function’s execution.
- Built-in properties like `name` and `length` provide information about the function.
