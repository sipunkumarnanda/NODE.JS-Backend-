### Detailed Notes on `Object.create()` and Prototype Inheritance

#### **Code Breakdown**

```javascript
const p1 = {
    fname: "Sipun",
    lname: "Kumar",
    greet() {
        console.log(`hello ${this.fname} ${this.lname}`);
    }
};

// Using Object.create()
const p2 = Object.create(p1);

// Equivalent Manual Syntax
// const p2 = {
//     __proto__: p1
// };

console.log("P1 is ", p1); // Logs the `p1` object
console.log("P2 is ", p2); // Logs an empty object {}
console.log(p2.fname);     // Logs "Sipun" from `p1` through prototype chain
```

#### **Understanding `Object.create()`**

1. **Purpose**:
   - The `Object.create(proto)` method creates a new object (`p2`) and sets its internal `[[Prototype]]` (or `__proto__`) to reference the `proto` object provided.
   - This allows `p2` to inherit properties and methods from `proto`.

2. **Behavior**:
   - If a property or method is not found on `p2`, the JavaScript engine looks for it in the prototype object (`p1` in this case).

3. **Empty Object**:
   - When `p2` is created with `Object.create(p1)`, it starts as an empty object (`{}`). 
   - Any properties or methods directly added to `p2` will belong to `p2` itself and wonâ€™t affect `p1`.

4. **Prototype Chain**:
   - If `p2.fname` is accessed:
     - JavaScript first looks for `fname` directly on `p2`.
     - If not found, it checks the prototype chain (`p2.__proto__`), which is `p1`.
     - If `fname` exists in `p1`, its value is returned.

#### **Key Concept: Prototype Chain**

- **Prototype Lookup**:
  - When accessing properties or methods on an object, JavaScript searches in the following order:
    1. The object itself (`p2`).
    2. The object's prototype (`p2.__proto__` or `p1` in this case).
    3. If not found, it moves up the prototype chain until it reaches `Object.prototype`.
    4. If the property/method is not found even in `Object.prototype`, it returns `undefined`.

---

#### **Manual Syntax**

Using `Object.create()` is equivalent to manually setting the prototype via the `__proto__` property:

```javascript
const p2 = {
    __proto__: p1
};
```

Both methods result in `p2` inheriting from `p1`.

---

#### **Logging Behavior**

1. `console.log("P1 is ", p1);`
   - Logs the `p1` object: 
     ```javascript
     {
         fname: "Sipun",
         lname: "Kumar",
         greet: [Function: greet]
     }
     ```

2. `console.log("P2 is ", p2);`
   - Logs an empty object `{}` because no properties have been directly added to `p2`.

3. `console.log(p2.fname);`
   - Logs `"Sipun"` because the `fname` property is found in the prototype (`p1`).

#### **How `Object.create()` Works Behind the Scenes**

```javascript
const p2 = Object.create(p1);

// Internally equivalent to:
const p2 = {};
p2.__proto__ = p1; // Set the prototype of p2 to p1
```

---

#### **Benefits of `Object.create()`**

1. **Prototypal Inheritance**:
   - It provides a clean and explicit way to establish inheritance between objects.

2. **Custom Objects**:
   - You can create custom objects with shared behavior or properties.

3. **Avoid Constructor Functions**:
   - Enables inheritance without needing constructors or `class`.

#### **Example: Adding Properties to `p2`**

You can add properties directly to `p2`:

```javascript
p2.age = 25; // Adds `age` to `p2` directly
console.log(p2.age); // 25
console.log(p2); // { age: 25 }
console.log(p2.fname); // "Sipun" (inherited from `p1`)
```

---

#### **Prototype Lookup Example**

```javascript
p2.greet(); 
// "hello undefined undefined"
// `this.fname` and `this.lname` in `p1.greet` reference `p2.fname` and `p2.lname`
// Since `p2` doesn't have `lname`, `undefined` is logged.

p2.fname = "Ankita";
p2.greet(); 
// "hello Ankita undefined"
// `this.fname` references `p2.fname` (overridden locally).
```

#### **Conclusion**

- **`Object.create()`**:
  - Explicitly creates an object linked to another object (`p1`).
  - It is a modern, readable way to establish prototypal inheritance.

- **Prototype Chain**:
  - Allows an object to inherit properties/methods from another object.
  - Lookups happen in the current object first, then in its prototype chain.
