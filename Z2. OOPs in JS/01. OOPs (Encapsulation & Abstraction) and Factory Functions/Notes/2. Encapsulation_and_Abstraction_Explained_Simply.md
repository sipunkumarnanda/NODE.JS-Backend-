### Difference Between Encapsulation and Abstraction

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - **Definition**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is usually done using access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `public`).
   - **Main Purpose**: Protecting the internal state of an object from external modification and controlling how the data is accessed or modified.
   - **Example**: Imagine a TV remote. You can change the channel using buttons on the remote, but you don’t need to know how the internal circuit of the remote works to change the channel. The internal workings (data) are hidden and protected from you, but you interact with the remote through the provided interface (methods).

   - **In Code**: 
     ```javascript
     class Car {
       constructor(model, year) {
         this.model = model;  // public data
         this._year = year;   // private data
       }
       getYear() {
         return this._year;  // only accessible via a method
       }
       setYear(year) {
         if (year > 2000) {
           this._year = year;  // we control the modification
         } else {
           console.log('Year is too old');
         }
       }
     }
     const myCar = new Car('Tesla', 2022);
     console.log(myCar.getYear()); // 2022
     myCar.setYear(1999);  // Year is too old
     ```

2. **Abstraction**:
   - **Definition**: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features or functionalities. It's like using a feature without knowing the inner workings.
   - **Main Purpose**: Simplifying complex systems by providing a clear interface while hiding unnecessary details.
   - **Example**: When you use a smartphone, you don’t need to know how the processor or memory works. You only use the screen, buttons, and apps to interact with it. The inner workings (abstraction) are hidden, but the interface is simple and easy to use.

   - **In Code**: 
     ```javascript
     class Animal {
       makeSound() {
         throw new Error("Method 'makeSound()' must be implemented.");
       }
     }

     class Dog extends Animal {
       makeSound() {
         console.log('Woof Woof');
       }
     }

     class Cat extends Animal {
       makeSound() {
         console.log('Meow Meow');
       }
     }

     const dog = new Dog();
     dog.makeSound();  // Woof Woof
     const cat = new Cat();
     cat.makeSound();  // Meow Meow
     ```

### Key Differences:

| **Aspect**         | **Encapsulation**                                      | **Abstraction**                                       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**          | Bundling data and methods, hiding data through access control. | Hiding complex implementation, showing only necessary details. |
| **Visibility**     | Controls visibility of data (e.g., private or public).  | Hides complexity and shows only the interface.        |
| **Purpose**        | Protects and organizes data.                          | Simplifies usage of an object.                        |
| **Example**        | Hiding internal data (e.g., using getter/setter methods). | Simplifying a complex system like a phone interface.  |

### Simple Analogy:
- **Encapsulation**: Think of a **safe box**. You can put your important things inside it, and you can lock it with a key. The box (object) contains both the things (data) and the lock mechanism (methods). Only the right key (method) can open it, so no one can access your things directly.
  
- **Abstraction**: Now, think of the **ATM machine**. You don’t need to know how the bank database works or how money is transferred. You only need to know how to insert your card, type your PIN, and get cash. The complex system is hidden, and you only see the simple interface.

The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - This means bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also helps to hide the internal workings (implementation details) and only expose the necessary information.
   - **Example**: Think of a toy car. The car has buttons to make it move or stop. You don’t need to know the complex workings inside the car, like how the wheels spin or how the motor works; you just press a button to make it move.

2. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction is about simplifying complex systems by hiding the unnecessary details and showing only the essential features. It helps us focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.
   - **Example**: When you drive a car, you don’t need to know how the engine works or how the fuel is converted into motion; you only need to know how to use the steering wheel and pedals to control the car.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It helps in reusing code, and creating a hierarchy of classes.
   - **Example**: Imagine a class called "Animal." From this, we can create other classes like "Dog" or "Cat" that inherit all the common behaviors of an "Animal" (like eating, sleeping), but can also have their unique behaviors (like barking for dogs or meowing for cats).

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, but they can act differently depending on the class they are instantiated from.
   - **Example**: Imagine you have a class called "Shape," and inside it, you have a method called `area()`. Now, you can have two subclasses, "Circle" and "Rectangle," that both use the `area()` method, but each calculates area in its own way. This is polymorphism, where the same method name behaves differently based on the object (circle or rectangle).

### Simple Summary:
1. **Encapsulation** = Bundling data and methods together and hiding details.
2. **Abstraction** = Hiding complex details and showing only essential features.
3. **Inheritance** = Reusing code and creating relationships between classes.
4. **Polymorphism** = Using the same method name to behave differently depending on the object.
