### **Custom EventEmitter: A Detailed Explanation**

This code is an implementation of a **Custom EventEmitter** class in JavaScript. It's designed to handle custom events like the built-in `EventEmitter` from Node.js.

Let's break down the code and its functionality:

---

### **Class Definition: `MyEventEmitter`**

```javascript
class MyEventEmitter{
    constructor(){
        this._events = {}
    }
```
- **`constructor()`**:  
  - This is the constructor of the `MyEventEmitter` class.  
  - It initializes an empty object **`this._events`**, which will store event names as keys and arrays of event handlers (listeners) as values. This object will be used to track registered event listeners for different events.

---

### **`on()` Method: Register Event Listeners**

```javascript
on(eventsName, handler){
    if(this._events[eventsName]){
        this._events[eventsName].push(handler)
    }
    else{
        this._events[eventsName] = [handler]
    }
}
```
- **`on(eventsName, handler)`**:  
  - This method is used to **register event listeners** for a given `eventsName`. It takes two parameters:
    - **`eventsName`**: The name of the event (e.g., `"x"`, `"y"`).
    - **`handler`**: The callback function that should be executed when the event is emitted.
  
  - **Logic**:  
    - **If** an event with the given `eventsName` already exists in `this._events`, the method **adds** the handler to the array of existing listeners for that event.
    - **If** the event doesn't exist in `this._events`, the method **creates a new array** with the handler as its first element.

---

### **`emit()` Method: Trigger Events**

```javascript
emit(eventName, ...args){
    if(this._events[eventName]){
        this._events[eventName].forEach(event => {
            event(...args)
        });
    }
}
```
- **`emit(eventName, ...args)`**:  
  - This method is used to **trigger the event** and call all the registered listeners for that event.
  - **Parameters**:
    - **`eventName`**: The name of the event to emit (e.g., `"x"`, `"y"`).
    - **`...args`**: Any additional arguments passed will be forwarded to the event listeners. This is known as **rest parameters**.
  
  - **Logic**:  
    - **If** there are listeners for the given `eventName`, it loops through all the listeners and calls each one with the provided arguments (`...args`).
    - The `forEach` method is used to iterate over all event handlers and call them.
    - **Each event handler** is invoked with the arguments passed during the `emit()` call.

### **`prints()` Method: Log Events**

```javascript
prints() {
    console.log(this._events);
}
```
- **`prints()`**:  
  - This method is used to **print** the current state of `_events`, showing the registered event listeners.
  - It's useful for debugging to check the internal state of the `MyEventEmitter` instance.

---

### **Using the `MyEventEmitter` Class**

```javascript
const emitter = new MyEventEmitter()

emitter.on("x", (()=>{
    console.log("X event is Fired");
}))

emitter.on("y", ((a, b, c)=>{
    console.log("Y event is Fired");
    console.log(`Hello ${a}, ${b}, ${c}`);
}))
```
- **Creating an Instance**:  
  - `const emitter = new MyEventEmitter()` creates an instance of the `MyEventEmitter` class.
  
- **Registering Event Listeners**:  
  - **For Event "x"**:  
    - The first event listener is registered for the event `"x"`.  
    - When this event is emitted, the message `"X event is Fired"` will be logged to the console.
  
  - **For Event "y"**:  
    - The second event listener is registered for the event `"y"`.  
    - This listener takes three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`.  
    - When the event `"y"` is emitted, it will log `"Y event is Fired"` and also print the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

---

### **Emitting Events**

```javascript
// emitter.prints()
emitter.emit("x")
emitter.emit("y", 1, 2, 3)
```
- **Emitting Event "x"**:  
  - `emitter.emit("x")` will trigger the event `"x"`.
  - Since there is a listener for the event `"x"`, it will log `"X event is Fired"` to the console.
  
- **Emitting Event "y"**:  
  - `emitter.emit("y", 1, 2, 3)` will trigger the event `"y"`.  
  - The arguments `1`, `2`, and `3` are passed to the listener.
  - The listener for `"y"` will log `"Y event is Fired"` and then print `"Hello 1, 2, 3"` to the console.

---

### **Expected Output:**

```bash
X event is Fired
Y event is Fired
Hello 1, 2, 3
```

### **Summary**

- **Custom EventEmitter Class**: The `MyEventEmitter` class allows you to register event listeners and emit events. The class uses an object (`this._events`) to store event names and their associated listeners.
  
- **`on()` Method**: Used to register a listener for a particular event. It either adds the listener to an existing array (if the event is already present) or creates a new array with the listener.
  
- **`emit()` Method**: Used to trigger an event and call all listeners registered for that event. You can pass any arguments that will be forwarded to the listeners.
  
- **`prints()` Method**: Logs the current state of the `_events` object, showing all registered events and their listeners.
  
- **Use Case**: This custom event emitter can be used when you need to manage custom events in an application and want to allow other parts of the system to respond to certain actions asynchronously.

### **Next Steps**
- You can extend this class by adding more methods, like `once()` to handle one-time listeners or `off()` to remove listeners.
