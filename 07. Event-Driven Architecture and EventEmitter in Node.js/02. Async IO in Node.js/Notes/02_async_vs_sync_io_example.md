### **02 async vs sync io example**

```javascript
// Example: Asynchronous I/O with `fs.readFile`
import fs from 'fs';

// Schedule a non-blocking operation using `setTimeout`
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Hii"); // This is scheduled as a non-blocking operation to execute after 0ms.
}, 0);

// Perform an asynchronous file read using `fs.readFile`
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf-8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error reading file:", err); // Logs an error if the file cannot be read.
        return;
    }
    console.log(data); // Logs the content of the file once it is read.
});

// **Output:** 
// 1. Hii
// 2. <Content of file.txt>
//
// Explanation of the Output:
// - `setTimeout` schedules its callback to run after 0 milliseconds, but the exact execution depends on the event loop.
// - Since `fs.readFile` is asynchronous, it begins reading the file in the background while the event loop continues executing other tasks.
// - The `setTimeout` callback ("Hii") gets executed first because it is added to the event queue with a minimal delay (0ms). 
// - Once the file reading is complete, the callback of `fs.readFile` is executed, printing the content of the file.
//
// Key Takeaways:
// 1. Node.js uses an **event loop** to manage asynchronous operations like `setTimeout` and `fs.readFile`.
// 2. Asynchronous I/O is non-blocking, meaning it doesn't hold up the execution of other code while waiting for I/O tasks to complete.
// 3. Callbacks (like the ones for `setTimeout` and `fs.readFile`) are executed when their associated tasks are finished.

### **As a JavaScript Teacher**
Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough:

1. **What is Happening Here?**
   - `setTimeout` is **non-blocking**. It schedules a task to execute after 0 milliseconds but doesn’t pause the program while waiting.
   - `fs.readFile` is also **non-blocking**, meaning the file reading starts, and the program doesn’t wait for it to finish. Instead, a callback is registered to handle the result.

2. **Order of Execution**
   - **`setTimeout` fires first** because it's added to the event queue with minimal delay.
   - The file reading (`fs.readFile`) happens in the background. Once it completes, its callback is added to the event queue and executed.

3. **Why Doesn't the File Content Print First?**
   - Node.js executes code in the **call stack** first (synchronous tasks) and processes the **event queue** later (asynchronous tasks like `setTimeout` or `fs.readFile`).

4. **Real-World Applications**
   - This pattern is essential for building **scalable applications**. For example, if your application needs to handle multiple file uploads or database requests simultaneously, blocking the event loop would degrade performance. Node.js’s non-blocking I/O allows these tasks to happen concurrently.

### **Key Notes**
- Always handle errors in asynchronous callbacks (e.g., `if (err)` block in `fs.readFile`).
- Understanding the event loop is critical to mastering asynchronous programming in Node.js.
- This example demonstrates the difference between **non-blocking** (`fs.readFile`) and **blocking** operations (like `fs.readFileSync`).
