### **Why `const { address: {[cityKey], [stateKey]} } = object` Throws an Error**

---

#### **Error Code:**
```javascript
const object = {
    name: "Ankita",
    age: 22,
    address: {
        city: "BBSR",
        state: "Odisha",
    },
};

const cityKey = "city";
const stateKey = "state";

const { address: { [cityKey], [stateKey] } } = object; // ❌ Throws SyntaxError
```

---

#### **Reason for the Error:**
- In JavaScript object destructuring, **dynamic keys** (using `[key]`) do not automatically create a variable with the same name as the key. Instead, the computed key is resolved to the corresponding property value in the object.
- If you use `[cityKey]` or `[stateKey]` directly without assigning it to a new variable, JavaScript does not know what variable to create or where to store the value.

In short, JavaScript expects you to provide a variable name for the extracted value when using dynamic keys.

---

#### **Correct Usage with Assignment to Variables:**
To fix this, assign the resolved values to variable names using the `:` syntax.

```javascript
const { address: { [cityKey]: cityName, [stateKey]: stateName } } = object;

console.log(cityName); // "BBSR"
console.log(stateName); // "Odisha"
```

Here:
- `[cityKey]: cityName` means:
  1. Resolve `cityKey` (which is `"city"`) to get the value of the `"city"` property in the `address` object.
  2. Assign this value to the variable `cityName`.

---

#### **Key Points to Remember:**
1. **Dynamic Keys Must Be Computed and Assigned:**
   You cannot destructure a dynamic key without explicitly assigning it to a variable:
   - ❌ `const { address: { [key] } } = obj;`
   - ✅ `const { address: { [key]: value } } = obj;`

2. **Dynamic Keys Work Only in the Right Context:**
   - Dynamic keys are resolved **only when placed inside `[ ]`**.
   - The key itself is not the variable name; you must specify a variable to store the value.

---

#### **Final Working Code:**
```javascript
const object = {
    name: "Ankita",
    age: 22,
    address: {
        city: "BBSR",
        state: "Odisha",
    },
};

const cityKey = "city";
const stateKey = "state";

const { address: { [cityKey]: cityName, [stateKey]: stateName } } = object;

console.log(cityName); // "BBSR"
console.log(stateName); // "Odisha"
```

---

#### **Why Does the First Code Throw an Error?**
- `const { address: {[cityKey], [stateKey]} } = object;`
  - JavaScript cannot determine what variable to create when it sees `[cityKey]` or `[stateKey]` without an explicit assignment.
  - This results in a **`SyntaxError`**, as destructuring requires a **target variable** to store the extracted value.

### Topic: Object Destructuring by Dynamic Key

Object destructuring by dynamic keys is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows us to extract or assign values to variables dynamically based on keys that are determined at runtime. This topic is particularly useful when dealing with objects where the keys are not known beforehand but are instead derived programmatically.

---

### **1. What is Object Destructuring?**

Object destructuring is a feature in ES6 that enables us to extract properties from objects and assign them to variables in a concise and readable way.

**Basic Syntax**:
```javascript
const obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = obj;

console.log(name); // "John"
console.log(age);  // 30
```

In this example, `name` and `age` are directly extracted from the `obj` object.

---

### **2. Dynamic Keys in Objects**

Dynamic keys allow us to access or manipulate an object’s properties using variables instead of hardcoded property names.

**Example of Accessing Object Values Dynamically**:
```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const key = "name";

console.log(obj[key]); // "Alice"
```
Here, `key` is a variable holding the string `"name"`. Using `obj[key]`, we dynamically access the value of the `name` property.

---

### **3. Object Destructuring with Dynamic Keys**

When we destructure an object, the key names are usually static. However, we can simulate dynamic key destructuring by using computed property names (via bracket notation) and a helper variable.

**Example**:
```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const dynamicKey = "name";

// Extract the value of the dynamic key
const { [dynamicKey]: value } = obj;

console.log(value); // "Alice"
```

#### **Explanation**:
1. **`[dynamicKey]`**: This uses the value of the `dynamicKey` variable as the key to access the corresponding property in the object.
2. **`: value`**: This renames the extracted value to `value`.

---

### **4. Practical Use Case**

#### Use Case: Retrieving Configuration Data
Imagine you have a configuration object, and you want to extract specific properties based on dynamic user input.

**Example**:
```javascript
const config = { apiKey: "123ABC", dbName: "testDB", port: 8080 };
const userInput = "apiKey";

const { [userInput]: extractedValue } = config;
console.log(extractedValue); // "123ABC"
```

---

### **5. Accessing and Assigning Values Dynamically**

You can not only access but also assign values to object properties dynamically.

#### Dynamic Key Assignment:
```javascript
const obj = {};
const dynamicKey = "username";
obj[dynamicKey] = "JohnDoe";

console.log(obj); // { username: "JohnDoe" }
```

#### Dynamic Key Update:
```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice" };
const dynamicKey = "name";
obj[dynamicKey] = "Bob";

console.log(obj); // { name: "Bob" }
```

---

### **6. Combining Object Destructuring and Dynamic Keys**

#### Extracting Multiple Values Dynamically:
```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "Wonderland" };
const keys = ["name", "city"];

keys.forEach((key) => {
    console.log(obj[key]); // Dynamically logs values of "name" and "city"
});
```

#### Nested Object with Dynamic Keys:
```javascript
const obj = { user: { name: "Alice", age: 25 } };
const dynamicKey = "name";

const { user: { [dynamicKey]: value } } = obj;

console.log(value); // "Alice"
```

---

### **7. When to Use Dynamic Key Destructuring?**

Dynamic key destructuring is useful in scenarios where:
1. **Key names are determined at runtime**: For example, based on user input or external API response.
2. **Dynamic property access**: When processing objects with unpredictable key names.
3. **Complex nested structures**: For accessing deeply nested values dynamically.

---

### **8. Limitations and Considerations**
1. **Key Must Exist**: If the key doesn’t exist in the object, the value will be `undefined`.
2. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where dynamic keys may lead to runtime errors if not properly validated.
   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: "Alice" };
   const key = "age";
   const { [key]: value = "Not Found" } = obj; // Default value
   console.log(value); // "Not Found"
   ```

---

### **9. Comparison with Static Key Access**

| **Static Key Access**         | **Dynamic Key Access**         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Directly uses property names. | Uses variables to determine keys. |
| Example: `obj.name`           | Example: `obj[dynamicKey]`     |
| Simple and straightforward.   | Flexible but slightly complex. |

---

### **10. Summary Notes**

- **Object Destructuring**: Simplifies the process of extracting values from objects.
- **Dynamic Keys**: Allow access to properties using variables.
- **Dynamic Key Destructuring**:
  - Syntax: `{ [dynamicKey]: value } = obj`
  - Use cases include runtime-determined keys, API responses, and configuration handling.
- **Limitations**:
  - Ensure the key exists in the object or provide a default value to avoid `undefined`.
