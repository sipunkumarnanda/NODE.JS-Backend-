Yes, in a browser environment, the **`window` object** is the **global execution context** in JavaScript. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### What is the Global Execution Context?
- The **Global Execution Context** is the default execution context where your JavaScript code runs when it is not inside any function or block.
- It is created as soon as the JavaScript code starts executing.

### Why is `window` the Global Execution Context?
- In a browser environment, the **`window` object** is the global object. All global variables and functions defined in your code become properties of the `window` object.
- For example:
  ```javascript
  var a = 10;
  function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }

  console.log(window.a); // 10
  window.greet(); // "Hello"
  ```

### Key Points:
1. **Global Variables and Functions**:
   - Declaring variables with `var` or functions in the global scope makes them properties of `window`.
   - However, variables declared with `let` or `const` are not added to the `window` object but still belong to the global execution context.
     ```javascript
     var x = 5; 
     let y = 10; 
     const z = 15;

     console.log(window.x); // 5
     console.log(window.y); // undefined
     console.log(window.z); // undefined
     ```

2. **`this` in the Global Context**:
   - In the global execution context, `this` refers to the `window` object in browsers.
     ```javascript
     console.log(this === window); // true
     ```

3. **Browser-Specific**:
   - The `window` object is specific to browsers. In non-browser environments like Node.js, the global object is `global`, not `window`.

4. **Global Objects in `window`**:
   - The `window` object contains other global objects, such as `console`, `document`, `setTimeout`, and more:
     ```javascript
     console.log(window.console); // Console object
     console.log(window.setTimeout); // Function: setTimeout
     ```

### Summary:
In a browser:
- The **global execution context** is represented by the `window` object.
- Variables and functions declared globally (with `var`) are properties of the `window` object.
- The `this` keyword refers to `window` in the global context.

In non-browser environments (e.g., Node.js), the global object is not `window`, but something else like `global`.
