Object destructuring is a concise and readable way to extract values from objects and assign them to variables. It simplifies the process of retrieving values and helps make code cleaner.

## Destructured Variables and Mutability

Destructured variables will not change, as they only reference the original properties at the time of destructuring. However, if you mutate the object itself, the destructured variable will reflect those changes since it references the original object.

**Example:**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

const { name, age } = person;

// Mutate the original object
person.age = 35;

console.log(age);       // Outputs: 30 (since `age` was captured at the time of destructuring)
console.log(person.age); // Outputs: 35 (the original object has been mutated)
```

## Renaming and Combining with Functions

Destructuring can be combined with renaming properties, making function parameters more explicit or avoiding name conflicts.

**Example:**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

function printDetails({ name: fullName, age: years }) {
  console.log(`Name: ${fullName}, Age: ${years}`);
}

printDetails(person);  // Outputs: Name: John, Age: 30
```

Here, `name` is destructured and renamed as `fullName`, and `age` as `years`, providing more descriptive variable names within the function.

## Handling Missing or Undefined Properties

If a property is missing or `undefined`, the destructured variable will be `undefined` unless a default value is provided.

**Example:**
```javascript
const person = { name: 'John' };
const { age = 25 } = person;

console.log(age);  // Outputs: 25 (default value used since `age` is undefined)

const person = { age: 30 };
const { age = 25} = person;

console.log(age);  // Outputs: 30 
```

---

## Destructuring with Dynamic Property Names

If you want to destructure a property but the key is dynamic (stored in a variable), you can use computed property names.

**Example:**
```javascript
const key = 'age';
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

const { [key]: personAge } = person;
console.log(personAge);  // Outputs: 30
```

Here, the value of the `key` variable (`age`) is used to dynamically destructure the property from the `person` object.

## Summary of Object Destructuring

- **Basic Destructuring**: Extract properties into variables directly.
- **Renaming Variables**: Assign properties to new variable names.
- **Default Values**: Provide default values if properties are missing or `undefined`.
- **Nested Destructuring**: Destructure properties from nested objects.
- **Rest Operator**: Collect remaining properties into a new object.
- **Function Parameters**: Pass object properties directly into functions via destructuring.
- **Mutability**: Destructured variables reflect the value at the time of extraction.
- **Dynamic Property Names**: Use dynamic keys to extract properties.

## Practical Benefits

- **Cleaner code**: Reduces the need for repetitive code.
- **More readable**: Clearly defines which properties are being accessed or used.
- **Flexible**: Works well with nested data structures and complex objects.

Object destructuring is a powerful feature in JavaScript that makes it easier to work with objects, especially when dealing with large or deeply nested objects, ensuring your code is more concise and easier to read.
