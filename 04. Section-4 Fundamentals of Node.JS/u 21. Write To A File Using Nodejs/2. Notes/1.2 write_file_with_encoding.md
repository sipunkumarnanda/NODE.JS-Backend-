### Why Do We Specify Character Encoding During File Writing?

Character encoding is essential when working with text files to ensure that the written content is stored correctly and can be read properly by any program or system that accesses the file later. The default behavior of file operations might not always align with the desired encoding, so specifying it ensures consistency and avoids potential issues.

### Key Reasons for Specifying Character Encoding (`'utf8'` in This Case):

1. **Define How Text is Encoded into Bytes**:
   - Computers store data as bytes, but text characters need to be converted to a byte format to be stored in files.
   - `'utf8'` is a widely used encoding that represents characters efficiently and supports many languages.

2. **Ensure Consistency**:
   - Without specifying encoding, the system might default to one (e.g., binary or platform-specific encoding), which could cause issues when sharing the file across systems.

3. **Avoid Corruption or Misinterpretation**:
   - If the file is written in one encoding (e.g., UTF-16) but read later assuming a different encoding (e.g., UTF-8), the content may appear corrupted or unreadable.

4. **Ease of Use Across Platforms**:
   - Specifying `'utf8'` ensures that the file is compatible with most systems and software that expect UTF-8 encoding, which is the standard for text interchange on the web.

### What Happens Without Specifying Encoding?

If you omit the encoding argument:
- The content will be written as raw bytes by default.
- This can cause issues if you expect the file to store human-readable text because the default encoding may vary by system or Node.js version.
- For example:
  ```javascript
  await fs.writeFile(filePath, content); // Default is raw binary data
  ```
  The file may not open correctly in text editors.

### Example Code with Encoding:

#### With Encoding:
```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises';

const filePath = './greetings.txt';
const content = 'Hello, Node.js!';

try {
  // Writing text to the file using UTF-8 encoding
  await fs.writeFile(filePath, content, 'utf8');
  console.log('File written successfully!');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error writing file:', error);
}
```

#### Without Encoding (Binary Write):
```javascript
try {
  // Writing content as raw bytes
  await fs.writeFile(filePath, content);
  console.log('File written successfully!');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error writing file:', error);
}
```
- In this case, the file might contain unexpected data and won't be human-readable unless the default encoding happens to match the intended format.

### Why UTF-8 is Recommended:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: UTF-8 is the standard character encoding on the web and across most modern platforms.
- **Efficient Storage**: It uses 1 byte for English characters and up to 4 bytes for less common characters.
- **Wide Support**: It supports virtually all characters in use today, including emojis and special symbols.
