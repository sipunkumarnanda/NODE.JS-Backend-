### Notes on Delayed Output in Asynchronous File Operations

The delay in output when using `fs.appendFile` occurs because file operations like appending data are **asynchronous**. This means the program doesn't wait for the operation to complete before moving to the next instruction, which can lead to race conditions.

#### Code Breakdown:

1. **Writing to the File**:
   ```javascript
   fs.writeFile('file-1.txt', "Hyyy Ram is a Good Boy , He Codes Daily..... ");
   ```
   - Creates or overwrites `file-1.txt` with the provided content.
   - The operation is asynchronous, so the program immediately proceeds without waiting.

2. **Appending Data**:
   ```javascript
   fs.appendFile('./file-1.txt', fileContent2);
   ```
   - Appends `fileContent2` to the file.
   - The program does not wait for the append operation to finish before executing subsequent lines.

3. **Reading the File**:
   ```javascript
   const data = await fs.readFile('./file-1.txt', "utf-8");
   ```
   - Pauses execution with `await` until the file content is read.
   - However, if the `fs.appendFile` operation is still in progress, the read operation may not include the appended data.

#### Why the Delay Happens:

- **Asynchronous Nature**:
  File operations like `writeFile`, `appendFile`, and `readFile` are non-blocking. They execute in the background, allowing the program to continue without waiting for their completion.

- **Race Condition**:
  The `readFile` operation might start before the `appendFile` operation finishes, resulting in incomplete or inconsistent data being read.

#### Solution: Use `await` to Ensure Sequential Execution

You can fix this issue by explicitly waiting for each asynchronous operation to complete before proceeding:

```javascript
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';

// Write to the file
await fs.writeFile('file-1.txt', "Hyyy Ram is a Good Boy , He Codes Daily..... ");

// Append data
const fileContent2 = "Iam File Content - 2 ";
await fs.appendFile('./file-1.txt', fileContent2); // Ensure append operation completes

// Read the file
const data = await fs.readFile('./file-1.txt', "utf-8"); // Read after append is done
console.log(data);
```

---

#### Corrected Output:
With `await`, the output will consistently include the appended data:

```
Hyyy Ram is a Good Boy , He Codes Daily..... Iam File Content - 2
```

---

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Always use `await`**: When the order of execution matters, using `await` ensures one operation finishes before the next starts.
- **Avoid Race Conditions**: By explicitly waiting for each file operation, you prevent overlapping tasks that can lead to inconsistent results.
- **Understand Promises**: If you donâ€™t use `await`, you must handle asynchronous operations properly using `.then` or similar mechanisms.
