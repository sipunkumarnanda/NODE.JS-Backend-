### **Base64 Encoding Rules (Explained in Detail):**

---

#### **1. At least 3 Bytes should be there to work with**
- **Explanation:**  
  Base64 encoding works with blocks of 3 bytes (24 bits). If there are fewer than 3 bytes in the input, it cannot form a complete set of 24 bits.  
  For example:
  - Input: `"abc"`
  - Binary representation: `01100001 01100010 01100011` (3 bytes = 24 bits)
  - These 24 bits are split into 4 groups of 6 bits each:  
    `011000 010110 001001 100011`  
  - Each group is then mapped to a character from the Base64 table.

  If the input is shorter than 3 bytes, Base64 uses padding to ensure the total bits are a multiple of 6.

#### **2. If 3 Bytes are not there, Base64 encoding will add multiple zeros to fill the remaining bits**
- **Explanation:**  
  When the input length is not a multiple of 3, the encoder appends zeros to complete the missing bits, and the resulting encoded string is padded with the `=` character to indicate this.  
  For example:
  - Input: `"a"` (1 byte = 8 bits)  
    Binary representation: `01100001`  
  - To complete 24 bits, zeros are added:  
    `01100001 00000000 00000000`  
  - This is split into 4 groups of 6 bits:  
    `011000 010000 000000 000000`  
  - The corresponding Base64 characters are:  
    `YQ==`  
  Here, `==` indicates that padding was used to complete the encoding.

#### **3. Data should be in multiples of 3 Bytes**
- **Explanation:**  
  Base64 encoding is designed to process data in 24-bit chunks (3 bytes = 24 bits). If the input size is not a multiple of 3, the encoder uses padding to make it so. This ensures that every Base64 encoded string has a length that is a multiple of 4 characters.  

  **Key Points:**
  - For input data that is exactly a multiple of 3 bytes, no padding (`=`) is required.
  - If the input size leaves 1 byte extra, two `=` characters are used as padding.
  - If the input size leaves 2 bytes extra, one `=` character is used as padding.

  **Example:**  
  - Input: `"abcd"` (4 bytes = 32 bits)  
    Binary representation: `01100001 01100010 01100011 01100100`  
  - Split into 6-bit groups:  
    `011000 010110 001001 100011 011001 000000`  
  - Since the last 6-bit group is incomplete, a zero is added to complete the group, and one `=` is added as padding.  
  - Result: `YWJjZA==`

### **Summary Table**
| Input Bytes Count | Encoded Output Length | Padding (`=`) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 3                 | 4                     | 0             |
| 2                 | 4                     | 1             |
| 1                 | 4                     | 2             |

Base64 ensures a consistent structure while maintaining the integrity of the original binary data, even if the input size is not ideal.
