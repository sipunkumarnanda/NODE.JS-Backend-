### **Differences Between ASCII, Unicode, UTF, Base64, TypedArray, and DataView**

1. **ASCII**:  
   - 7-bit encoding for **128 characters**.  
   - Supports English letters, digits, and basic symbols.  
   - Limited to English.

2. **Unicode**:  
   - A universal standard for representing characters from all languages.  
   - Defines **code points** (e.g., `U+0041` for 'A').  

3. **UTF-8 vs UTF-16 vs UTF-32**:  
   - **UTF-8**: Variable-length (1–4 bytes), backward-compatible with ASCII, memory-efficient for English.  
   - **UTF-16**: Variable-length (2 or 4 bytes), better for non-English languages.  
   - **UTF-32**: Fixed-length (4 bytes), simplest but memory-heavy.

4. **Base64**:  
   - Converts **binary data** into **ASCII text** for safe transmission.  
   - Encodes 3 bytes into 4 Base64 characters.  

5. **TypedArray**:  
   - Allows working with **binary data** in fixed-size chunks (e.g., `Uint8Array` for 8-bit integers).  
   - Used for performance-critical applications like image and file processing.  

6. **DataView**:  
   - Provides **low-level control** to manipulate binary data.  
   - Works with **endian formats** (big-endian or little-endian).

**Summary**: ASCII is outdated; Unicode and UTFs handle global text. Base64 is for encoding binary data into text. TypedArray and DataView are tools for binary data manipulation.

| **Feature**         | **ASCII**                                              | **Unicode**                                           | **UTF-8**                                              | **UTF-16**                                           | **UTF-32**                                  | **Base64**                                                                 | **TypedArray**                                | **DataView**                                                                                                                                 |

| **Definition**       | Character encoding using 7 bits.                     | Universal character set for all languages.          | Variable-length encoding for Unicode.                 | Fixed-length 16-bit encoding for Unicode.          | Fixed-length 32-bit encoding for Unicode. | Encoding binary data as text using 64 characters.                            | Views for handling binary data in ArrayBuffers. | A flexible way to read/write multiple data types in an ArrayBuffer.                                                                  |
| **Bits Per Char**    | 7 bits                                                | Variable (depends on encoding: UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.) | 1–4 bytes per character.                             | 2 bytes per character.                              | 4 bytes per character.                   | Encodes binary into 6-bit chunks (4 chars for 3 bytes).                      | Directly access underlying binary ArrayBuffer. | Custom read/write of numbers or strings from an ArrayBuffer with specific endianness (big/little).                                   |
| **Character Set**    | English letters, digits, symbols only (128 chars).   | Supports all languages and symbols.                 | Supports all Unicode characters.                     | Supports all Unicode characters.                   | Supports all Unicode characters.        | Not for characters; used to encode binary data like images, videos, etc.    | Operates at binary byte level.              | Operates at binary byte level with type-specific, customizable reads.                                                               |
