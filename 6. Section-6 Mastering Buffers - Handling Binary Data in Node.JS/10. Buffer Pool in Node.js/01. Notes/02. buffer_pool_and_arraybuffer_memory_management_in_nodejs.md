Yes, you're right. In the **Buffer Pool** (which is a concept used in Node.js for optimizing memory allocation), the bytes of separate `ArrayBuffer` instances are **not** necessarily placed contiguously.

### Explanation:

- **Buffer Pool**: In Node.js, when you use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`, the internal memory used for buffers is managed using a **Buffer Pool**. This pool pre-allocates a large chunk of memory for buffers to improve performance and reduce the need for repeated memory allocation.
  
- **Memory Allocation**: The memory allocated from the Buffer Pool is divided into smaller chunks, and these chunks may not be contiguous. In fact, when you create a new `Buffer` using `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`, it may get a portion of this pre-allocated memory, but it doesn't mean the buffers will always be contiguous in memory. The allocation process is not guaranteed to place the buffers right next to each other.

  - **Non-contiguous Allocation**: This behavior is an implementation detail that helps Node.js avoid fragmentation and improve performance. The allocation of buffers from a pool reduces the overhead of allocating memory on each buffer request and helps avoid the repeated expense of garbage collection in some cases.

### Example:

```javascript
const a = Buffer.allocUnsafe(4); // Allocates from the buffer pool
const b = Buffer.allocUnsafe(4); // Allocates another portion from the same pool

console.log(a.buffer === b.buffer);  // True, as both `a` and `b` share the same ArrayBuffer from the pool
```

However, the **position of bytes** within the `ArrayBuffer` might not be next to each other. If you were to inspect the `byteOffset` of multiple buffers created from the pool, you'd see that they may not start immediately after each other.

### Conclusion:
- The `ArrayBuffer` used by Node.js for the buffer pool can be fragmented internally (not contiguous) to optimize for memory management.

Correct! In the **Buffer Pool** (which is an ArrayBuffer used internally by Node.js for handling buffers), the memory for different `ArrayBuffer` instances is not necessarily allocated contiguously. This is because the **Buffer Pool** manages multiple buffers by allocating chunks of memory that can be reused efficiently, and the memory for each buffer may be separated by gaps or different memory regions.

This behavior is part of the internal optimization of memory allocation, where:

- The memory for each buffer is typically allocated from a larger pool (ArrayBuffer) to avoid frequent allocations and deallocations.
- The **byte offsets** of the buffers within the **Buffer Pool** may vary, meaning they could be placed at non-contiguous locations in memory. 

This non-contiguous memory allocation allows better memory management and performance optimization in Node.js when handling many buffers.
