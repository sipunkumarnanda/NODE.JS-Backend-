### Topic: Why We Use Base64 and Why It Increases File Size

#### Why Do We Use Base64 Encoding?

Base64 encoding is a method of converting binary data into a text-based format. This is necessary for certain systems or protocols that are text-based and cannot handle raw binary data directly. Some common reasons for using Base64 include:

1. **Compatibility with Text-Based Systems**: 
   - Systems like email (SMTP), JSON, or XML may not support raw binary data and require textual representation.
   - Base64 ensures that binary data is safely encoded as plain text.

2. **Safe Transmission Over Text-Based Protocols**:
   - Protocols like HTTP, WebSockets, and REST APIs often expect data in a text format.
   - Base64 ensures the integrity of binary data when transmitting it over these protocols.

3. **Embedding Binary Data in Text Documents**:
   - Base64 allows binary data (e.g., images, audio) to be embedded directly within text documents like HTML, CSS, or JSON, making it easy to share as a single file.

4. **Avoiding Data Corruption**:
   - Base64 eliminates the possibility of binary data being misinterpreted during transfer or storage.

#### Why Does Base64 Increase File Size?

Base64 encoding increases the size of the data because of the way it works:
1. **Conversion to 6-Bit Groups**:
   - Base64 encoding takes 3 bytes (24 bits) of binary data and converts it into 4 Base64 characters.
   - Each Base64 character represents 6 bits of data.
   - This results in a size increase of **33%** (4/3 ratio).

2. **Padding**:
   - If the original data size is not a multiple of 3 bytes, Base64 adds `=` padding characters to ensure the output length is divisible by 4.
   - This padding further contributes to the file size increase.

#### Example of File Size Increase:

1. **Original Data**:
   - Binary data: 3 bytes (24 bits).

2. **Base64 Encoded Data**:
   - 3 bytes are converted into 4 Base64 characters (4 bytes).
   - This results in a size increase of approximately 33%.

3. **Impact with Larger Files**:
   - For every 1 MB (1,048,576 bytes) of binary data:
     - Base64 encoded size = 1,048,576 × 4 / 3 ≈ 1,398,101 bytes (1.33 MB).

#### When to Use Base64:

1. When binary data needs to be embedded in text-based formats (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML).
2. For ensuring data compatibility with systems that handle only text (e.g., email attachments in MIME format).
3. When transmitting binary data over text-based protocols like HTTP.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Base64 solves compatibility issues** by converting binary data into a safe text format.
2. **File size increases by ~33%** because of the conversion from 8-bit binary to 6-bit Base64 characters.
3. Base64 is useful but should only be used when necessary to avoid unnecessary data bloat. For large files, binary transmission (e.g., streams) is preferred.
