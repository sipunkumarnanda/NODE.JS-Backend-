### When copy an object in JavaScript using the assignment operator (`=`), you are not creating a new object; instead, you are creating a reference to the same object in memory. This means that any changes made to the copied object will also affect the original object. In contrast, using the spread operator (`...`) creates a shallow copy of the object, which means that while the top-level properties are duplicated, nested objects remain referenced.

### Example of Reference Copy with Assignment Operator

Consider the following example:

```javascript
const originalObject = { name: 'apple', price: { amount: 120 } };
const referenceCopy = originalObject;

// Modifying a property in the reference copy
referenceCopy.name = 'banana';
referenceCopy.price.amount = 100;

console.log(originalObject); // Output: { name: 'banana', price: { amount: 100 } }
console.log(referenceCopy);   // Output: { name: 'banana', price: { amount: 100 } }
```

In this case:
- `referenceCopy` points to the same object as `originalObject`.
- Changing `referenceCopy.name` and `referenceCopy.price.amount` also changes `originalObject`, since both variables reference the same object.

### Example of Shallow Copy with Spread Operator

Now, let's look at how the spread operator works:

```javascript
const originalObject = { name: 'apple', price: { amount: 120 } };
const shallowCopy = { ...originalObject };

// Modifying a property in the shallow copy
shallowCopy.name = 'banana'; // Changes only the shallow copy
shallowCopy.price.amount = 100; // Affects original due to shared reference

console.log(originalObject); // Output: { name: 'apple', price: { amount: 100 } }
console.log(shallowCopy);    // Output: { name: 'banana', price: { amount: 100 } }
```

In this example:
- The `shallowCopy` is created using the spread operator, which copies top-level properties.
- Changing `shallowCopy.name` does not affect `originalObject`, but changing `shallowCopy.price.amount` does because both objects share a reference to the same nested `price` object.

### Summary of Differences

1. **Assignment Operator (`=`)**:
   - Creates a **reference** to the original object.
   - Changes to either variable affect the same underlying object.
   - Not suitable for creating independent copies.

2. **Spread Operator (`...`)**:
   - Creates a **shallow copy** of the object.
   - Top-level properties are duplicated, but nested objects are still referenced.
   - Suitable for copying objects when you do not need deep cloning.

### When to Use Each Method

- **Use Assignment Operator** when you want multiple variables to refer to the same object (e.g., for shared state).
- **Use Spread Operator** when you want a new object that has its own top-level properties but can still share references for nested structures.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while both methods can be used to "copy" objects, they serve different purposes and have different implications for how changes to those objects will affect one another. Understanding these differences is crucial for managing state and data in JavaScript effectively. If you need a completely independent copy of an object, especially one with nested structures, consider using deep copy methods such as `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject))` or libraries like Lodash's `_.cloneDeep(obj)`.
