# resources and commands related to binary, hexadecimal, and accessing Unicode:

### Resources

1. **Unicode Table:**
   - [Unicode Table - Symbl.cc](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/)  
     This website provides an interactive Unicode table where you can find the Unicode code points and their respective characters. It's useful for exploring Unicode characters and understanding their hexadecimal values.

### Commands to Access Binary and Hexadecimal Data in the Terminal

1. **xxd Command:**
   - The `xxd` command is used to create a hex dump of a given file. It converts the file content into a human-readable hexadecimal format.  

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   xxd text.txt
   ```

   This command outputs the hexadecimal representation of the contents of `text.txt`. You'll see the byte addresses, hexadecimal bytes, and their corresponding ASCII representation.

2. **xxd -b Command:**
   - The `-b` flag with the `xxd` command is used to display the binary (bit-level) representation of the contents of a file.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   xxd -b text.txt
   ```

   This command will show the file content in binary form, which is useful for analyzing the exact bit-level structure of the data.

3. **xxd -g 1 Command:**
   - The `-g` option specifies the number of bytes to group together in the output. Using `-g 1` will display one byte per group. This is useful if you want to see the file's binary or hexadecimal representation broken down byte-by-byte.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   xxd -g 1 text.txt
   ```

   This command will display each byte in the file separately, showing the byte address, the byte in hexadecimal form, and the ASCII equivalent.
