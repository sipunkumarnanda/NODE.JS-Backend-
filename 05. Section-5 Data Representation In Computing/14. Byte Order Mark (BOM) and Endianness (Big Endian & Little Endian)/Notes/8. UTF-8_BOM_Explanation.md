# Why We Get EF BB BF When Reading a File Saved with UTF-8 BOM ? 

**Question**: When we save a file using UTF-8 BOM and read that file using only UTF-8, why do we get the value `EF BB BF` at the beginning?

**Answer**: When we save a file using UTF-8 BOM, it is saved as Big Endian and the BOM `FE FF` is added at the beginning. When encoded with UTF-8, we get `EF BB BF`.

### UTF-8 Rules:
How can we store the binary value of `FE FF` using UTF-8?

- `FE FF` in binary is `1111 1110 1111 1111` (a 16-bit number). In UTF-8, we need 3 bytes to store this.
  
  UTF-8 format for 3 bytes is `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx` (we can place the values in the `x` positions).

Now, let's break down the conversion:

- `FE FF` in binary: `1111 1110 1111 1111` (16 bits).
- Place it in the UTF-8 format: `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
- After placing the binary value: `1110 1111 1010 1011 1011 1111`

This gives us the bytes:
- `11101111` = `EF`
- `10111011` = `BB`
- `10111111` = `BF`

Thus, when we save a file using UTF-8 BOM and read that file using UTF-8, we get the value `EF BB BF` at the beginning.
