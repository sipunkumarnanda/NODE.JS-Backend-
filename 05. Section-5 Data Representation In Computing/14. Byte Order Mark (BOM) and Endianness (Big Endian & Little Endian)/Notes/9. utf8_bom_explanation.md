# UTF-8 BOM: Does It Appear Before Every Character?

- No, the **UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark)** sequence `EF BB BF` is not added before every character in a file. It is added **only at the very beginning of the file** as a signature to indicate that the file is encoded in UTF-8.

Here’s how it works:

### **Details of UTF-8 BOM**
1. **Purpose**:  
   The BOM is used to:
   - Identify the file as being encoded in UTF-8.
   - Indicate the encoding format to programs reading the file.

2. **Location**:  
   - The BOM appears only **once**, at the very start of the file.
   - It is not repeated before every character or string in the file.

3. **Impact on Content**:
   - When present, the BOM itself is part of the file’s byte sequence and will occupy the first three bytes.
   - Text editors or programs that support BOM will interpret and ignore it during rendering, while programs that do not expect a BOM might display unwanted characters (like `ï»¿`).

### **Example:**
Suppose the content of a file is `Hello, World!`:

- **Without BOM**:  
  The raw byte sequence will look like this:
  ```
  48 65 6C 6C 6F 2C 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 21
  ```
  Each character is encoded directly without any additional marker.

- **With BOM**:  
  The raw byte sequence will look like this:
  ```
  EF BB BF 48 65 6C 6C 6F 2C 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 21
  ```
  The BOM (`EF BB BF`) appears only at the start, followed by the UTF-8-encoded text.

### **Key Point:**
The BOM is a **file-level marker** and not a character-level marker. It does not precede each character but only indicates the encoding type at the start of the file.

Question- When we save a file using UTF-8 BOM and Read that file using Only UTF-8 Then we get value of EF BB BF at First , Explain Why ? 
Ans - When we save a file using UTF-8 BOM , Then its save as Big Endian and its ad FE FF at First , so when encode with only UTF-8 WE get EF BB BF 

UTF-8 Rules 
How can we Stote FE FF 's Binary Value Using UTF-8 
FE FF - Binary value is = 1111 1110 1111 1111 (it is a 16 bits number ) , so In UTF-8 We require 3 Byte , SO 
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx (If we want to store a 16 bits number we can place its values in x ) , so 

FE FF - Binary value is = 1111 1110 1111 1111 (it is a 16 bits number )

Now place in UTF-8 Place Holder 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
11101111  10111011 10111111  , We get this 
Now If we Convert This binary Value to Hex , We will get EF BB BF
11101111 = EF 
10111011 = BB 
10111111 = BF 

SO , When we save a file using UTF-8 BOM and Read that file using Only UTF-8 Then we get value of EF BB BF at First
