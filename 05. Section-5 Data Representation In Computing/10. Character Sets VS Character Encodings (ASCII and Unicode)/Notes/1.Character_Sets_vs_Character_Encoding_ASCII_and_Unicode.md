### **Character Sets vs Character Encoding (ASCII and Unicode)**

#### **Q1. What is a character?**

A **character** is any symbol that can be written, printed, or displayed, and is used in a written language. It includes:
- **Letters**: Uppercase (A, B, C) and lowercase (a, b, c)
- **Digits**: (0, 1, 2, â€¦)
- **Punctuation marks**: (., ?, !, etc.)
- **Whitespace characters**: (spaces, tabs, newlines)
- **Control characters**: Non-visible characters that control text flow, like newline (LF) or carriage return (CR).

In computing, characters are mapped to numerical values for processing, storage, and transmission in digital form.

#### **Q2. What is a character set? Explain ASCII, Unicode, and ISCII.**

**Character Set**:  
A **character set** is a collection of characters that a system can recognize, store, or manipulate. Each character is assigned a unique numerical value called a **code point**.

1. **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**:  
   ASCII is one of the oldest character sets and is a 7-bit encoding standard used to represent 128 characters. It includes:
   - **Control characters**: (codes 0â€“31), like newline, tab, etc.
   - **Printable characters**: (codes 32â€“127) include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, punctuation marks, and some special symbols.
   
   ASCII uses 7 bits per character, allowing it to represent **2^7 = 128** distinct characters.

2. **Unicode**:  
   Unicode is a much more comprehensive character set designed to include characters from all languages and symbols around the world. It supports over **143,000** characters from various writing systems. It uses a unique **code point** for each character. Unicode can represent characters using various encoding formats like **UTF-8**, **UTF-16**, and **UTF-32**.

3. **ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange)**:  
   ISCII is an encoding standard used to represent characters in several Indian languages. It was introduced by the Indian government to handle regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, etc. ISCII uses 8 bits, allowing for **256 characters**.

#### **Q3. Why does ASCII use only 128 numbers? Explain 2^7.**

ASCII uses **7 bits** for each character, and since **2^7 = 128**, this means there are **128 unique combinations** of bits that can represent characters. These 128 values cover the basic characters in the English alphabet, numbers, and some special symbols.

- **Why only 128 characters?**
   - Early computers used 7 bits to represent characters.
   - 7 bits can store **128 distinct values**, which was enough to cover the English alphabet, digits, and common punctuation marks.

As ASCII was limited to 128 characters, it cannot support characters from other languages (like Chinese, Arabic, etc.) or special symbols like emojis. This is one reason Unicode was introduced.

#### **Q4. What is UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32?**

**UTF (Unicode Transformation Format)** encodings define how to represent Unicode characters using different numbers of bytes. Here's an explanation of the three main encoding types:

1. **UTF-8**:
   - **Variable-length encoding**: Uses **1 to 4 bytes** to represent a character.
   - **Compatibility with ASCII**: For characters from the ASCII set (0â€“127), UTF-8 uses just 1 byte, making it space-efficient for English text.
   - **Efficient for text in most languages**: Characters from other languages or symbols can require 2, 3, or 4 bytes.
   - **Example**: The letter "A" is represented by **0x41** (1 byte in UTF-8), while the emoji "ðŸ˜Š" is represented by **0xF0 0x9F 0x98 0x8A** (4 bytes).

2. **UTF-16**:
   - **Variable-length encoding**: Uses **2 or 4 bytes** to represent a character.
   - **2 bytes for most characters**: Characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) are encoded using 2 bytes.
   - **4 bytes for supplementary characters**: Characters beyond the BMP, like certain emojis, are encoded using 4 bytes.
   - **Example**: The letter "A" is represented by **0x0041** (2 bytes in UTF-16), and the emoji "ðŸ˜Š" is represented by **0xD83D 0xDE0A** (4 bytes).

3. **UTF-32**:
   - **Fixed-length encoding**: Uses **4 bytes** for every character, regardless of complexity.
   - **No variable length**: This means each character takes up the same amount of memory (4 bytes).
   - **Example**: The letter "A" is represented by **0x00000041** (4 bytes in UTF-32), and the emoji "ðŸ˜Š" is represented by **0x0001F60A** (4 bytes).

| Dec | Char | Dec | Char | Dec | Char | Dec | Char |
|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|

### **Unicode Table (Example)**

Below are a few examples of **Unicode characters** along with their hexadecimal code points:

| Character | Unicode Code Point (Hex) | Description           |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| A         | U+0041                   | Latin Uppercase A     |
| a         | U+0061                   | Latin Lowercase a     |
| ðŸ˜Š        | U+1F60A                   | Smiling Face Emoji    |
| ä½         | U+4F60                    | Chinese Character (ni)|
| â‚¹        | U+20B9                    | Indian Rupee Symbol   |
| ðŸ¦„        | U+1F984                   | Unicorn Emoji         |

In Unicode, every character has a **code point** assigned in hexadecimal notation (e.g., U+0041 for 'A'). Characters like emojis, non-English characters, and symbols are represented by a unique code point.

### **Examples of UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 Encoding**

Let's take the letter "A" (U+0041) and the emoji "ðŸ˜Š" (U+1F60A) and see how these characters are encoded in **UTF-8**, **UTF-16**, and **UTF-32**:

1. **Character: 'A' (U+0041)**
   - **UTF-8**: 0x41 (1 byte)
   - **UTF-16**: 0x0041 (2 bytes)
   - **UTF-32**: 0x00000041 (4 bytes)

2. **Character: 'ðŸ˜Š' (U+1F60A)**
   - **UTF-8**: 0xF0 0x9F 0x98 0x8A (4 bytes)
   - **UTF-16**: 0xD83D 0xDE0A (4 bytes)
   - **UTF-32**: 0x0001F60A (4 bytes)

### Summary:

- **Characters** are individual symbols, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and other special symbols.
- **Character sets** define a collection of characters and their respective codes, such as **ASCII**, **Unicode**, and **ISCII**.
- **ASCII** uses 128 characters with 7-bit encoding.
- **Unicode** supports a vast range of characters from different writing systems and is encoded using **UTF-8**, **UTF-16**, and **UTF-32**.
- **UTF-8** is space-efficient for English text, **UTF-16** is efficient for text in many other languages, and **UTF-32** provides fixed-length encoding.

This should serve as a detailed, final set of notes for understanding character sets and encodings!
