### **Notes on Decimal to Octal Conversion**

#### **Introduction to Decimal and Octal Systems:**

- **Decimal System**: The decimal number system is base-10, using digits from 0 to 9.
- **Octal System**: The octal number system is base-8, using digits from 0 to 7.

#### **Converting Decimal to Octal**:

To convert a decimal number to an octal number, we use the method of **repeated division by 8** and record the remainders. The result is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order (from last to first).

### **Step-by-Step Method:**

1. **Divide the Decimal Number by 8**:
   - Divide the decimal number by 8 and note the quotient and remainder.
2. **Record the Remainder**:
   - The remainder from each division becomes the digits of the octal number.
3. **Repeat the Division**:
   - Continue dividing the quotient by 8 until the quotient becomes 0.
4. **Read the Remainders**:
   - The octal number is the remainders read in reverse order.

### **Example: Convert Decimal 234 to Octal**

**Step 1**: Divide 234 by 8.
- Quotient = 29, Remainder = 2 (This is the rightmost digit in the octal number)

**Step 2**: Divide 29 by 8.
- Quotient = 3, Remainder = 5

**Step 3**: Divide 3 by 8.
- Quotient = 0, Remainder = 3 (This is the leftmost digit)

**Octal Representation**:  
- The remainders (from last to first) give us the octal number: `352`

So, **234 (decimal) = 352 (octal)**.

### **Using JavaScript for Decimal to Octal Conversion:**

In JavaScript, we can convert decimal to octal using the **`toString()`** method with the radix 8.

```javascript
let decimalNumber = 234;
let octalString = decimalNumber.toString(8);  // Convert to octal string
console.log(octalString);  // Output: '352'
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The `toString(8)` method converts the decimal number into a string representation in base-8 (octal).

### **Another Example with ParseInt (Convert Octal to Decimal)**:

We can also use `parseInt()` to convert an octal string back to a decimal number.

```javascript
console.log(parseInt('352', 8));  // Output: 234
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The `parseInt()` function takes two arguments: the string to be converted and the base (8 for octal).
- In this case, `'352'` is the octal string, and `8` tells JavaScript to interpret it as an octal number.
- The output is `234`, which is the decimal equivalent.

### **Why Octal Numbers?**

- **Octal Numbers**: Historically, octal was used because it's closely related to binary (base-2) systems. Every 3 binary digits (bits) correspond to a single octal digit. For example:
  - `110 111` (binary) = `67` (octal).
- However, in modern computing, binary and hexadecimal (base-16) systems are more commonly used.

### **Octal in JavaScript (ES6 and Later)**:

- **Prefix '0o'**: In JavaScript (ES6+), octal numbers are written with the `0o` prefix, such as `0o352`, to indicate that the number is in octal format.
  
```javascript
const octalNumber = 0o352;  // Octal number
console.log(octalNumber);    // Output: 234
```

---

### **Important Points to Remember**:

1. **Octal uses digits from 0 to 7**, so numbers like 8 or 9 are not valid in the octal system.
2. **JavaScript's octal syntax**: The `0o` prefix is used for writing octal literals in modern JavaScript (since ES6).
3. **Converting back to Decimal**: Use `parseInt()` with base 8 to convert an octal number back to decimal.

---

### **Conclusion**:
Converting decimal numbers to octal is a fundamental concept in number systems, often used in computing. By understanding how to manually convert decimal to octal and using JavaScript methods like `toString(8)` and `parseInt()`, you can easily work with octal numbers in your code.
