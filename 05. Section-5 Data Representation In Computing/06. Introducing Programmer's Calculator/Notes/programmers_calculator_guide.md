### **Using Programmer’s Calculator on Windows**

#### **Steps to Access:**
1. Open the **Calculator** app:
   - Press `Windows + S` and type "Calculator," then hit **Enter**.
2. Switch to Programmer Mode:
   - Click the **Hamburger Menu** (three lines) in the top-left corner.
   - Select **Programmer**.

#### **Features in Programmer Mode:**
1. **Numeral Systems Conversion:**
   - Select from **Dec (Decimal)**, **Bin (Binary)**, **Oct (Octal)**, or **Hex (Hexadecimal)** at the left-hand side.
   - Input a value, and the calculator instantly converts it to all selected bases.
2. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - Perform operations like **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**, **NOT**, **Left Shift (<<)**, and **Right Shift (>>)**.
3. **Logical Bit Manipulations:**
   - Toggle individual bits of binary numbers.
4. **Byte Grouping:**
   - Switch between 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit modes.

### **Using Programmer’s Calculator on Mac**

#### **Steps to Access:**
1. Open the **Calculator** app:
   - Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight, type "Calculator," and hit **Enter**.
2. Enable Programmer Mode:
   - From the top menu, click **View > Programmer**.

#### **Features in Programmer Mode:**
1. **Base Conversion:**
   - Use the mode buttons at the bottom (**Hex**, **Dec**, **Oct**, **Bin**) to switch bases.
   - Input values in one base, and view the conversion in others.
2. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - Perform logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
3. **Binary Input:**
   - Enter binary values directly using the binary keypad.

### Example Operations:
#### **Convert 15 (Decimal) to Binary and Hexadecimal:**
1. Enter `15` in **Decimal Mode**.
2. Switch to **Binary**, and the result is `1111`.
3. Switch to **Hexadecimal**, and the result is `F`.

#### **Perform AND Operation on Binary Numbers:**
1. Input `1010` (binary).
2. Use the AND operation with `1100` (binary).
3. The result will display `1000` in binary.
